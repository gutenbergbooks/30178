<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>This book with its sad, reiterated story of wrong
and oppression is an indictment and an appeal. It
is an indictment of the system which produces
results so pitiful. It is an appeal to Christian
womanhood to right these wrongs and enlighten this
darkness by sacrifice and service. At the recent
Mohammedan Educational Conference in Bombay
the president of the gathering, the Agha Khan, himself
a leading Moslem, spoke very trenchantly of the
chief barriers to progress in the Moslem world.
The first and greatest of these barriers in his opinion
was "the seclusion of women which results in keeping
half the community in ignorance and degradation
and this hinders the progress of the whole."
Surely the ignorance and degradation of one-half
of a community which has a world population of
233 millions is a question that concerns all who
love humanity.</p>

<p>The origin of the veil of Islam was, as is well
known, one of the marriage affairs of Mohammed
himself, with its appropriate revelation from Allah.
In the twenty-fourth Surah of the Koran women
are forbidden to appear unveiled before any member
of the other sex, with the exception of near relatives.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>And so by one verse the bright, refining, elevating
influence of women was forever withdrawn from
Moslem society. The evils of the zenana, the
seraglio, the harem, or by whatever name it is called,
are writ large over all the social life of the Moslem
world. Keene says it "lies at the root of all the
most important features that differentiate progress
from stagnation."</p>

<p>In Arabia before the advent of Islam it was customary
to bury female infants alive. Mohammed
improved on the barbaric method and discovered a
way by which <i>all</i> females could be buried alive and
yet live on&mdash;namely, the veil. How they live on,
this book tells! Its chapters are not cunningly devised
fables nor stories told for the story's sake.
Men and women who have given of their strength
and service, their love and their life to ameliorate
the lives of Moslem women and carry the torch
of Truth into these lands of darkness write simply
the truth in a straightforward way. All the chapters
were written by missionaries in the various
lands represented. And with three exceptions the
writers were women. The chapter on Turkestan is
by a converted Moslem; and the two chapters on the
Yemen and the Central Soudan are by medical missionaries.
The book has as many authors as there
are chapters. For obvious reasons their names are
not published, but their testimony is unimpeachable
and unanimous. We read what their eyes have
seen, what their hands have handled, and what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>has stirred their hearts. It has stirred the hearts
of educated Moslems too, in Egypt as well as in
India. A new book on this very subject was
recently published at Cairo by Kasim Ameen, a
learned Moslem jurist. Although he denies that
Islam is the cause, yet speaking of the present relation
of the Mohammedan woman to man the author
says:</p>

<p>"Man is the absolute master and woman the
slave. She is the object of his sensual pleasures, a
toy, as it were, with which he plays, whenever and
however he pleases. Knowledge is his, ignorance
is hers. The firmament and the light are his, darkness
and the dungeon are hers. His is to command,
hers is to blindly obey. His is everything that is,
and she is an insignificant part of that everything.</p>

<p>"Ask those that are married if they are loved by
their wives, and they will answer in the affirmative.
The truth, however, is the reverse. I have personally
investigated the conditions of a number of
families that are supposed to be living in harmony,
peace, and love, and I have not found one husband
who truly loved his wife, or one wife who evinced
a sincere affection for her husband. This outward
appearance of peace and harmony&mdash;this thin veneering&mdash;only
means one of three things, namely, either
the husband is made callous and nonchalant by incessant
strife, and has finally determined to let things
take their course; or the wife allows herself to be
utilized as an ordinary chattel, without uttering a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>protest; or both parties are ignorant and do not
appreciate the true value of life. In this last case,
the parties are nearer to a sort of happiness than in
the former two, although their happiness is negative
in quantity and evanescent in nature." ...</p>
<p>The writers of the following chapters believe that
the only remedy for these social evils is the Gospel.
That is why they write.</p>

<p>The occasion that led to the preparation and collection
of this series of papers was the Cairo Conference.
One of the most interesting sessions of
that first general Conference on behalf of the Mohammedan
world, held at Cairo April 4-9, 1906,
was that on Woman's Work for Women. But the
time was far too short nor had there been preparation
for a full and free presentation and discussion
of the condition and needs of our Moslem sisters.
Those that loved them felt this and yet the women
present seized the opportunity and unitedly sent
forth the following appeal, endorsed by the whole
Conference:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">"<i>Women's Appeal.</i></p>

<p>"We, the women missionaries, assembled at the
Cairo Conference, would send this appeal on behalf
of the women of Moslem lands to all the women's
missionary boards and committees of Great Britain,
America, Canada, France, Germany, Switzerland,
Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Holland, Australia,
and New Zealand.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>
<p>"While we have heard with deep thankfulness
of many signs of God's blessing on the efforts already
put forth, yet we have been appalled at the
reports which have been sent in to the Conference
from all parts of the Moslem world, showing us
only too plainly that as yet but a fringe of this
great work has been touched.</p>

<p>"The same story has come from India, Persia,
Arabia, Africa, and other Mohammedan lands, making
evident that the condition of women under Islam
is everywhere the same&mdash;and that there is no hope
of effectually remedying the spiritual, moral, and
physical ills which they suffer, except to take them
the message of the Saviour, and that there is no
chance of their hearing, unless we give ourselves to
the work. <i>No one else will do it.</i> This lays a
heavy responsibility on all Christian women.</p>

<p>"The number of Moslem <i>women</i> is so vast&mdash;not
less than one hundred million&mdash;that any adequate
effort to meet the need must be on a scale far wider
than has ever yet been attempted.</p>

<p>"We do not suggest new organizations, but that
every church and board of missions at present working
in Moslem lands should take up their own
women's branch of work with an altogether new
ideal before them, determining to reach the whole
world of Moslem women in this generation. Each
part of the women's work being already carried on
needs to be widely extended. Trained and consecrated
women doctors; trained and consecrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>women teachers; groups of women workers in the
villages; an army of those with love in their hearts
to seek and save the lost. And, with the willingness
to take up this burden, so long neglected, for the
salvation of Mohammedan women, even though it
may prove a very cross of Calvary to some of us,
we shall hear our Master's voice afresh ringing
words of encouragement: 'Have faith in God. For
verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto
this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast
into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but
shall believe that these things which He saith shall
come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith.'
'Nothing shall be impossible unto you.'"</p></div>

<p>That this wonderful appeal might reach a wider
circle and that its skeleton form might be clothed
with the flesh and blood of real life experiences and
so be not a resolution but a revelation,&mdash;this book
was written. <i>May God give its message wings
through His Spirit</i></p>

<h2>HAGAR AND HER SISTERS</h2>


<p>"We must concentrate attention upon the mothers,
for what the mothers are, the children will be."
These words, spoken recently by a British statesman,
are but the thoughts of many who have tried
to save the children. And in looking at the millions
of Moslems in the world to-day, and wondering
why they are still as they were a thousand years
ago, rather drifting backward than advancing, we
turn to their women and find the cause. Mohammedan
law, custom, and the example of their
founder place woman on a level with beasts of
burden and no nation rises above the level of its
women.</p>

<p>The Lord Jesus is the only prophet come to this
world who has raised women to what God meant
them to be. It is only He who can save our Moslem
sisters. When Hagar returns to Christ Ishmael
shall live.</p>

<p>The story of Hagar, the mother of the Arabs, tells
us of a young girl sacrificed for the scheme and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>then the jealousy of an older woman who should
have loved and pitied her. And it seems to some
of us that it needs the widespread love and pity
of the women of our day in Christian lands to
seek and save the suffering sinful needy women of
Islam.</p>

<p>You cannot know how great the need unless you
are told; you will never go and find them until you
hear their cry. And they will never cry for themselves,
for they are down under the yoke of centuries
of oppression, and their hearts have no hope or
knowledge of anything better.</p>

<p>And so to-day, we want to make our voices heard
for them. We want to tell you, our sisters at home,
in words so plain that you can never again say:
"Behold, we knew it not."</p>

<p>"In the mouth of two witnesses shall every word
be established," was the law of Moses. In this book
you have the evidence of more than a score of witnesses
and they all speak the same things. Each one
tells only that which she knows. No incident is
given without personal knowledge, and most of the
writers have the experience of ten, fifteen, or twenty
years in the midst of the people of whom they tell.</p>

<p>Although we claim no literary merit, we have a
thrilling story and plead for a hearing.</p>

<p>Read for yourselves what is going on in the
lives of a hundred million women in the world to-day
and take this burden on your hearts before
God.</p>

<p>A long tress of dark hair, a white veil, a bit of
flower, and a shining necklace. They are there
above the bier of a young bride carried past our
window to her grave. There was another one yesterday,
and there will be more to-morrow. Hundreds
of child-wives and sixty-two per cent. they tell
us of all the babies born here, in Egypt, are taken
to an early grave. We cannot know these things
and not call upon you, our sisters, to come and try
to save them. They are passing away in an endless
procession, without ever having heard of Jesus,
without ever knowing that He died for them,
that an eternity of gladness and love may be
theirs.</p>

<p>Although the voices in this book sound from
many lands: Egypt, Tunis, Algiers, Morocco, Hausa
Land, East Africa, Arabia, Palestine, Syria, Turkey,
Bulgaria, Persia, India, one story is told and one
cry heard everywhere. There has been no communication
between the writers, but there is absolute
identity of evidence because all the Moslems of these
lands are under Mohammedan law.</p>

<p>The world-wide suffering of Moslem women
makes us read with wonder such words as were
recently spoken by the secretary of the Pan-Islamic
Society: "The Renaissance of Islam means the
renaissance of humanity." Does the speaker think
we are all blind, and deaf, and ignorant? These
pages may enlighten him. We read further Mustapha
Pasha Kamel's own words and tell him that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>in these he speaks the truth. They were spoken to
his own fellow-Moslems.</p>

<p>Mustapha Pasha Kamel said in the course of his
speech to his co-religionists:</p>

<p>"Conquer with the force of knowledge and history
the strong fortresses of prejudice and bigotry,
and open wide the gates of your heart for the reception
of Truth and Light. For a conquered people
there is no cure better than a passionate devotion
to Truth. Be ye, therefore, messengers of Light
and Truth, the missionaries of brilliant and triumphant
Truth, the army of physicians prescribing
the bitter pills of Truth. Tell the effete and feeble
rulers and princes, 'Awake from your deep slumber.
Recover soon from your drunkenness caused by the
possession of absolute authority, the boast of heraldry,
and the braveries of pomp and pageantry.
Awake ye, before the depth of degradation into
which your subjects have fallen sound the death-knell
of your rule and shake the very foundations
of your throne. Awake before the day overtakes
you when repentance and regrets will be of no
avail.' Tell the rich who waste so much of their
wealth in the pursuit of ignoble pleasures, and who
do not spare a farthing for a noble cause, 'Awake
before it is too late. Do not forget in the midnight
of your intoxication that a bitter day of reckoning
awaits you. Awake, arise, or be for ever fallen.
Your fates are bound up with those of your people
and your glory depends upon their prosperity. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>they rise, you rise. If they fall, you fall with them.
Wealth is a poison if it becomes an instrument of
evil; a life-giving antidote when devoted to a noble
purpose. Regard it therefore as a divine gift and
a sacred trust.' Tell the people who live the life of
animals and are led like dumb cattle: 'Awake, and
realize the true significance of life. Fill the earth
and adorn it with the result of your labors.' Gentlemen,
you alone can make them understand the full
meaning of life. O physicians! the patient is in a
critical state, and delay spells death." ...</p>

<p>If the thinking men of the Mohammedan world
really believe what is here said to them by their
own champion, we ask them will they not seek unto
God for a remedy? And it may be He will
turn their thoughts to their own homes, and let
them see <i>what is, why it is, and to think what
might be</i>.</p>

<p>The homes of the sons of Ishmael might be happy
and united, the abode of gladness and family love,
but they are the opposite of this. Few Mohammedans
know that such a home is possible. They
only know a place full of jealousy, of quarrelling and
evil talk. What wonder that they have the proverb:
"The threshold of the house weeps for forty days
when a girl is born."</p>

<p>Unwelcome at birth, unloved in her life-time, without
hope in her death; and she might be the joy of
your heart, the life of your home, and the hope of
your old age. Will you not ask yourselves, our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>brothers, can these things be? "Have we wandered
in the dark for centuries, misled by blind leaders of
the blind, and missing the good things offered us by
the God of Ishmael?" It was through Hagar his
mother that Ishmael lived.</p>

<p>"<i>She sat over against him, and lift up her voice
and wept. And God heard the voice of the lad, and
the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and
said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not, for
God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
Arise, lift up the lad and hold him in thine hand; for
I will make him a great nation. And God opened
her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went
and filled the bottles with water, and gave the lad
drink. And God was with the lad, and he grew, and
dwelt in the wilderness.</i>"</p>

<p>To-day we cry to our Father in Heaven to let us
be the messengers of comfort to Hagar&mdash;and we will
ask Him to open her eyes that she may see the Well
of the Water of Life, and that she may hold it to the
lips of her sons and daughters in the Moslem world.
The following touching incident and poem by one
who has labored long among Moslem women in
Persia may well be our opening prayer ere we
hear the cry of need from distant lands in these
chapters:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was the Communion Day in our Church, and
the service proceeded as usual. My thoughts were
all of my own unworthiness and Christ's love to
me, until Mr. E. asked the question nobody ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>notices, 'Has any one been omitted in the distribution
of the bread?' And it seemed to me I could see
millions on millions of women rising silently in
India, Africa, Siam, Persia, in all the countries
where they need the Lord, but know Him not, to
testify that they had been omitted in the distribution
of the bread and cup! And they can take it from
no hands but ours, and we do not pass it on. Can
Jesus make heaven so sweet and calm that we can
forgive ourselves this great neglect of the millions
living now, for whom the body was broken and the
blood shed, just as much as for us?"</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h2>

<h2>EGYPT, THE LAND OF BONDAGE</h2>


<p>Egypt was the home of the earliest civilization in
the world, which archæology traces back beyond
3000 years <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> The home of a race skilled both
in the fine and mechanical arts; loving nature, honoring
women, and deeply impressed with the seriousness
of life on both sides the grave. The
valley of the Nile, which is the true Egypt, is unlike
any other part of the world. It has neither Alpine
grandeur, nor pastoral softness, nor variety of plain
and upland, meadow and forest. Its low hills have
neither heather nor pine upon them. Egypt is the
land of light, of glowing sunshine, of moonlight
and starlight so brilliant that night is but a softer
day. From the time that Israel's ancestors went
down thither it has drawn men of every clime with
a peculiar fascination.</p>

<p>On the opposite page we have before us a glimpse
of the majestic Nile, stretching through one thousand
miles of desert till it flows into the Mediterranean
Sea. "Wherever the river cometh, there is
life." Everywhere along its banks the desert has
become fertile, and there are countless towns and
villages.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<p>The productive capacity of the land had always
depended upon the annual overflow of the Nile, but
every summer during the season of high Nile billions
and billions of cubic feet of water would roll away a
rich and wanton waste into the sea, simply because
there were not enough channels to carry it out into
the thirsty sands of the desert. Energetic men conceived
the idea of bringing these waste waters into
control, to carry them out through the surrounding
countries, bringing life and prosperity where there
was dearth and desolation. For this purpose several
great dams were built; one at Cairo, one at
Assiut and one at Assouan, making it possible to
store up much of the water which had formerly
gone to waste, and canals were dug to carry the life-giving
water out to the desert where thousands of
acres of land have been reclaimed.</p>

<p>The large cities of Egypt are densely populated.
A town of twenty-five thousand people is considered
a mere village. It might be wondered what the people
do for a livelihood, but they all seem to do something.
There are all sorts of tradesmen and artificers.
It is next to impossible to enumerate them,
there's the:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Richman, poorman, beggarman, thief;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doctor, lawyer, merchant, chief;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Butcher, baker,<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<p>There are few signs of extreme want, but disease
and deformity meet one everywhere, and blindness
is perhaps the most pitiful.</p>

<p>Egypt is largely an agricultural country, and
naturally the largest percentage of her inhabitants
are tillers of the soil. A little more than half belong
to the peasant class and are known as "fellaheen."
They are industrious after their own
fashion, conservative to the point of bigotry, yet
good-humored and peaceable. The peasant class
are the hope of Egypt. They look back to a past
full of crushing tyranny, political and religious, but
under the improved political condition of the country
the Egyptian peasant is beginning to widen his
horizon and to aim for education and civilization.
Poor they certainly are, but what of that when
they have enough to eat such as it is and can spend
their whole lives in sunshine and fresh air? Warm
enough with the lightest clothing, well sheltered by
the rudest cabin, no hard winters to provide against,
and no coal to buy.</p>

<p>Such is the physical condition of Egypt and the
Egyptian. What of the moral and spiritual?</p>

<p>Nine-tenths of the people are Mohammedans,
thus Mohammedan ideas rule the thought and manner
of life.</p>

<p>Because Mohammedans worship one God, many
people say, "Let them alone, their religion is good
enough for them, it is even better suited to them
than Christianity." It is true that Mohammedan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>ism
was a revolt against the idolatry and corruption
of the early Christian churches, but is that revolt,
even though an honest effort to find a purer form
of worship, any excuse for not holding out to them
the true way of salvation? Is not that revolt
rather a trumpet call to Christianity, wakening her
up to her great responsibility toward the unbelief
of Islam, whose apostasy was caused by the unfaithfulness
of the old Christian churches of the
East?</p>

<p>No one who has drunk deeply at the fountain of
evangelical truth can defend Islam. It has been
commonly supposed that the God of the Koran is
the God of the New Testament. Those who have
made the subject a matter of careful study and investigation
find that they are totally different. The
God of Christianity is a God of love, the God of
Islam is an Oriental despot.</p>

<p>The element of love is left out of both the religion
and morality of Islam. Marriage is not founded
upon love but upon sensuality. A mother was rebuked
for arranging a marriage for her fourteen-year-old
son. Her excuse was, "I do it to keep him
from learning the bad habit of visiting prostitutes."
The sensual nature has been trained in the Egyptian
to an indescribable degree of disgusting perfection.
As some one has said, "Mohammedans have added
a refinement of sensuousness to pagan sensuality."
As a result of this training men and women have
sunk to depths of degradation unconsciously mani<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>fested
in their customs, in their speech, and in their
life.</p>

<p>For twelve centuries the blight of Islam has fallen
over the fortunes of Egypt. Politics, commerce,
learning, all have felt its withering blast, but that
which has most keenly felt the blast and blight of
Islam is society. There is no word in the Arabic
language for home, the nearest approach to it being
"beit," which means "house" or "a place in which
to spend the night." To quote from an interesting
writer on this thought&mdash;"The word is lacking because
the idea is lacking." "Home, sweet Home"
with all its wealth of meaning is a conception foreign
to the average Oriental. An educated young
Moslem with advanced ideas in many respects was
asked if the members of his family took their meals
together. He said they did not, each one when he
became hungry told the servant to bring food.
"Would it not be better to eat together?" "Yes, it
would be much cheaper," he replied, showing that
the first ray of the beauty of the home circle had not
penetrated his active mind. How can it be otherwise
when woman, the heart and life of the family
circle, was in his mind because of inherited ideas
relegated to the position of prisoner and slave rather
than to that of companion and helpmeet? "It was
Islam that forever withdrew from Oriental society
the bright, refining, elevating influence of woman by
burying her alive behind the veil and lattice of the
Harem."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>
<p>Arabic poetry and literature is generally very
uncomplimentary to woman, characterizing her as a
donkey, or even a snake. The majority of the men
hoot at the gallantry and courtesy which Anglo-Saxon
etiquette demands of men towards women. Says
an Egyptian, "Our women must be beaten in order
to be made to walk straight." And beaten they are
for trifling offence by father, husband, brother, or
son as occasion demands. This custom is so common
that the women themselves expect a whipping
occasionally.</p>

<p>It has been said that the theology of Islam does
not give woman a place in heaven, but that statement
is incorrect. However, her place and station
in heaven seem to depend entirely upon the will of
her husband. Many husbands are like the old Moslem
sheikh who said, "I don't want my wives in
heaven. I prefer the Harem of beautiful, pure,
clean angels which God has provided for every good
Moslem." The privilege of prayer is practically
denied a young woman with children because of the
strict regulations of washing before prayer. Unless
these ablutions are done carefully according to rule,
prayer is void. A few old women do pray.</p>

<p>The nominal Christians dwelling in the midst of
Islam, though they hate Islam with all their hearts,
have yet imbibed much of their spirit in regard to
the treatment of women. A Coptic priest was
heard to say, "It is better for the women not to go
to church, for they can't keep quiet. They will eat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>and chatter during the service." Poor things!
What else could they do, shut off from the main
audience room as they always are behind a high
lattice screen, where they can neither see nor hear
what is going on!</p>

<p>Much can be said about the down-trodden condition
of Egyptian women. "As a babe she is unwelcome;
as a child untaught; as a wife unloved; as
a mother, unhonored; in old age, uncared for; and
when her miserable, dark, and dreary life is ended,
she is unmourned by those she has served." Heaven
is a forlorn hope, not because she is denied any of its
privileges, but because of the incapability of providing
her with enjoyments similar to those promised
to the other sex.</p>

<p>It has often been asserted that the institutions of
Islam elevated and improved the state of women,
but history and true incidents from life go to show
that her position was rendered by Islam more dependent
and degraded than before.</p>

<p>She is degraded and made servilely dependent by
seclusion. The veil and lattice of the Harem are
both Islamic institutions established by the Prophet
of Islam and founded upon incidents which occurred
in his own family; and they are certainly a faithful
commentary upon the sensuality and lewdness of
the times, with an unconscious recognition of the
fact that the religion of Islam was not of sufficient
moral force to improve the times. History has
verified this testimony and we only need to look
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>around in these countries to see for ourselves that
Mohammedanism, as its founder anticipated, has
not improved the morality of those who have embraced
its principles, but has rather excused and
given license to all sorts of lewdness. It is difficult
for people reared in Christian lands to have any conception
of the laxity of morals in Mohammedan
lands and it is a thing to be wondered at and excused
only on the grounds of ignorance of existing
conditions that English parents will allow their
young daughters to become resident teachers or
governesses in rich Mohammedan houses.</p>

<p>The whole system of Islam, in so far as it concerns
family life and the treatment of women, is
vile and revolting. The veil and lattice of the
Harem, even though established to guard her modesty
and purity, have degraded and debased her by
making her a prisoner.</p>

<p>As a child, she has before her only a few short
years in which she has an opportunity to go to
school and the effort to improve those few years is
very often fruitless, because just as she shows any
signs of budding womanhood (as early as at the
age of ten years and not later than thirteen years)
she must lay aside her books and "be hidden," as
they say in Arabic; then it is considered improper
and immodest for a girl to be seen in the
streets. Her education stops just at the point when
her mind is beginning to open up, and she is learning
to love her books. Thrown back into the seclu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>sion
of the Harem she soon forgets all she has
learned. Should she be energetic enough to try to
keep up her lessons and try to get reading matter,
she is met with the taunt, "Are you a scribe or a
lawyer, that you should read and write every day?"</p>

<p>The girls who have an opportunity of going to
school at all are in the minority, but for those who
do, as in Christian lands, there is a peculiar fascination
and joy connected with the first day of school
after a month or two of vacation. Girls, new pupils
and old, come trooping into the schoolroom enthusiastic,
eager, and bright, rejoicing with all the
ardor of childhood that they are allowed to come
back to their beloved school and that they are not
yet old enough to be "hidden." But there is a strain
of sadness in all this joy, for in their interchange of
confidences and family bits of news it comes out
that a certain Fatima and a certain Zeinab, their big
sisters, are sitting at home very sad and even shedding
bitter and rebellious tears because, poor things!
they have been "hidden" and their schooldays are
over.</p>

<p>A day or two after our school began, the teachers
and girls were all startled by a rustle of long garments
sailing in at the door. On closer observation
they soon saw that their visitor was none other than
little Habeeba of last year, who during the summer
had blossomed out into a woman by donning all the
trappings of a Harem lady, and she was truly "hidden,"
for not a speck of her face showed except one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>bright eye. She could not stay away from her
beloved school, she said, so had begged special permission
to come and spend an hour with her friends.</p>

<p>The seclusion of the Harem is more or less rigid
according to the caprice of some exacting husband
or mother-in-law. As far as the younger married
women's experience goes it is mother-in-law rule
literally, for seldom is a man permitted to take his
wife to a home of his own. The sons and even the
grandsons must bring their brides home to the
father's house and all be subject to the mother. A
household of fifty is no uncommon thing. Much of
the freedom of the younger women depends upon
what the old mother-in-law or grandmother-in-law
thinks proper. Often she rules with a hand of iron,
probably to make up for her own hard life in her
younger days, intermixed with an honest desire to
preserve and promote the honor and dignity of her
house. For the honor, dignity, and aristocracy of a
family are often estimated according to the rigor of
the seclusion of its women-folk.</p>

<p>Thousands of Egyptian women never step over
their own thresholds and many of them never make
complaint, only saying, "Oh, you know our men love
us very much; that is the reason they imprison us.
They do it to protect us."</p>

<p>Among the strictest people a young woman is not
permitted to be seen by even her father-in-law.
Nor is it allowable for her to be seen by any male
servants except eunuchs. Under such conditions it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>might be wondered how a woman could keep her
domestic machinery in running order, but as one
woman said, who had never seen the face of her
cook although he had been employed in her house
for thirteen years, when asked the question, "How
do you tell him what you want for dinner?" "Oh,
he knows my wants, but when I wish to give a particular
order, I tell the maid servant, she tells the
little boy servant, and he conveys the message to the
cook!"</p>

<p>It seems like the irony of fate that these women
who are kept in such strict seclusion should be so extravagantly
fond of society. They welcome in the
most hospitable manner any visitors of their own sex.
It is pitiful to see how they love to have glimpses of
the outside world. A missionary lady tells of a
woman whom she often visited, who had never been
outside of her house since her marriage, forty years
before, and who begged her to tell her something
about the flowers, saying, "Ah, you are happy
women, free to go here and there and enjoy life!"</p>

<p>Many people who know only the outside of Egyptian
life, when they hear that the women have
jewelry and beautiful dresses and servants to look
after every want, say they are happy and contented
in their seclusion, but those who visit them in their
homes and talk with them in their own language
know how they writhe under it, how they weary of
the idleness and monotony forced upon them. One
little woman, forced to spend her life behind closed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>shutters, would feign illness so as to get an opportunity
to call in her friend, the lady missionary
doctor, and, when rebuked, would laughingly say,
"What am I to do! I must see somebody to pass
away the time and I like to have you come to see
me, but you won't come unless I send you word I am
ill."</p>

<p>It seems part of the nature of the Egyptian to
distrust his womenfolk and to believe them capable
of any misdemeanor. Therefore they must be carefully
watched and kept in check. This distrust reacts
upon the nature and character of the women,
often making them truly unworthy of trust, but
many of them are very sensitive on the subject and
feel keenly this unfair position into which they are
thrown.</p>

<p>What has been said about the strict seclusion of
Egyptian women refers chiefly to the middle and
upper classes, for the poorest women, those of the
peasant class, have the greatest freedom. They go
about unveiled and manifest a character of marked
independence and self-reliance, but they are ignorant
beyond description, such a thing as books and
schoolroom being unknown quantities to them, and
their lot is a life of drudgery.</p>

<p>Many of the village women labor in the fields
from early morning to late at night, especially during
the cotton season, seven or eight months of the
year.</p>

<p>During the cotton-ginning season many women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>and girls work from 4 o'clock <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> to 9 o'clock <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>
in the cotton-ginning mills. Those in the vicinities
of larger towns are vendors of fruit, vegetables,
milk, cheese, and butter. On market days great
troops of village women can be seen on the country
roads, their wares in big baskets on their heads,
their babies perched astride their shoulders, wending
their way to town. Those who live in the larger
towns are often employed as hodcarriers for masons.</p>

<p>Their powers of endurance are marvellous. It is
a common occurrence for a woman to go out to pick
cotton as usual in the morning and to come back in
the evening, carrying her basket on her head and
in it her new-born babe, and it has been known for
a woman to start to town with her marketing on
her head, be detained an hour or two by the roadside
till she gives birth to her child, then with it
continue her journey.</p>

<p>Besides being a drudge the peasant woman is
nearly always a slave to her husband. Of course
she does not eat with him; if she goes out with
him she walks behind him while he rides the donkey,
which it is her duty to keep moving at a good
pace by prodding with a sharp stick. If there is
anything to carry she does it. He does manage to
carry his own cigarette and walking stick! Often,
too, she has to exercise her wits to tell her lord
amusing stories for his entertainment as they journey
by the way. One day some tourists met just
such a couple on a country road. The poor woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>was trudging along with a big child sitting astride
her shoulder while its father rode the donkey. The
suggestion was made that the child might ride if
its mother couldn't. To the credit of the smiling-faced
peasant the suggestion was followed.</p>

<h2>FROM UNDER THE YOKE OF SOCIAL EVILS</h2>


<p>Unhappy marriages are a natural result of the
seclusion of women in Egypt. It would be highly
improper for a man to see his bride until after he
had married her. He has not even had the privilege
of choosing her. His mother did that for him, and
it goes without saying that the young man is not
always suited. The story is told of a young man
who at his wedding feast was sitting so glum and
silent that his young friends teased him by saying,
"Brother! brother! Why so sad on this joyous occasion?"
In answer he said, "I have just seen my
bride for the first time and I am woefully disappointed.
She is ugly! tall, thin, and weak-eyed."
The tall "daughter-of-the-gods-girl" is not admired
in Egypt. Her short, fat, dumpy little sister is
much more according to Egyptian ideas of beauty.
"Cheer up! cheer up!" said his friends, "you are not
such a handsome fellow yourself that you should
have such a handsome wife!" Shaking his head
sadly, he said, "I feel like heaping ashes on my head.
If you don't believe me that she is ugly, go upstairs
and peep in at the Harem window and see for
yourselves." Glad of the chance of such a privilege,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>they did so and came back saying, "Brother, heap
more ashes on your head!"</p>

<p>Frequent divorce is a natural result of these unhappy
marriages. Divorce in any land is a social
evil but in Egypt it is especially so, because the
divorce laws are such that in a peculiar way woman
is degraded by them.</p>

<p>It is difficult to obtain exact figures regarding the
percentage of divorce, as all cases are not recorded.
There are some who say 50 per cent. of marriages
end in divorce, others say 80 per cent., and a prominent
Moslem when asked said 95 per cent. An
experienced missionary when asked her opinion,
said, "Divorce is so common that to find a woman
who lives all her life with one husband is the exception."</p>

<p>In fact it is such an exception that it is a subject
for remark, and a visitor in a house where such
happy conditions exist never fails to be told about it.</p>

<p>Many women have been divorced several times,
and a woman of twenty years of age may be living
with her third husband.</p>

<p>A native Bible woman who had worked among
Mohammedans for fourteen years when asked,
"How many men or women of twenty-five years of
age she thought likely to be living with their original
partners?" said, "Do you mean that they should
have kept to each other and that neither has been
divorced or married anybody else?"&mdash;"Yes." She
laughed and said, "Perhaps one in two thousand."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>
<p>This was probably an exaggeration, but it shows
that divorce is very common, and that the percentage
is even higher than those who love Egypt and her
people like to admit. It almost seems that the history
of one's Mohammedan acquaintances in Egypt
might be given in an endless stream of incidents
about divorce and the intrigue and hate and jealousy
attendant on this, the greatest social evil of Egypt.</p>

<p>Many a young man has no hesitation about marrying
and divorcing, keeping up the process for a year
or so till he at last finds a wife to suit him. If it
didn't degrade those he has cast aside, he might be
excused for doing so, as he has had no chance to
choose his wife intelligently.</p>

<p>A young man of some spirit was determined to
have a wife to please him and who would be congenial
to him. Seeing no other way to accomplish
it, he married and divorced in rapid succession six
times. The seventh was a queenly young woman,
gentle and refined in all her ways, in whom the
heart of her husband might well rejoice, yet the
terror daily hung over her that she might be divorced
in time like the other six. It was pathetic to see
how she tried to cultivate every little feminine art
to please her husband, how she tried to improve her
mind so as to be a companion to him, but constantly
with the fear of divorce lurking in her tender and
loving heart.</p>

<p>Among the lower classes marrying and divorcing
in rapid succession is a form of dissipation. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>pay-day comes, instead of going off on a big drink
(which, to the credit of Islam, is forbidden), they
use their money to defray the expenses of a season
of debauchery, marrying and divorcing as many
wives as possible while the money lasts. Picture the
degradation of the poor women who are the victims
(often unwilling victims) of such orgies.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to bring in here everything
that Mohammedan law says about divorce, but the
rules are many and complicated and almost too revolting
to put into words. It is enough to say
that the husband may divorce his wife without any
misbehavior on her part or without assigning any
reason. It is all left to the will and caprice of the
man, and he has only to say, "Woman, thou art
divorced," or he can even use metaphorical language
which must be understood by the ever-on-the-alert
wife to mean divorce, as when he says, "Thou art
free!" "Thou art cut off!" "Veil yourself!"
"Arise, seek for a mate!" etc., etc. A certain man
had been away for a week or so on a business trip.
He came home and the first words he said to his
wife, were, "I thought you had gone home to your
father's house!" She understood him to mean, and
rightly too, "I divorce thee!" so she packed up her
things and went off.</p>

<p>If a man pronounce his sentence of divorce only
once or twice it is revocable, but if he pronounces it
three times it is irrevocable, and the divorced wife
cannot be taken back by her husband till she has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>married to another man, has lived with him and been
divorced; then her former husband can take her
back. This is the most revolting and degrading
of all the divorce laws, and the prophet Mohammed
instituted it thinking that the very repulsiveness of
it would act as a restraint, but strange to say it only
seems to give more license.</p>

<p>A man will get into controversy with his friends
perhaps. To strengthen his statements he uses all
sorts of oaths, the strongest of which is, "I divorce
my wife by the triple divorce." It takes legal effect.
The poor man is in great distress, for he really loves
his wife. What is he to do? He must go through
the process of law to get her back. He hires a servant
or a strange peasant to marry her. The revolting
part is that the poor woman has to live with
this hired husband till he is again hired to divorce
her, when she is free to go back to her former husband.
This case actually happened, and many like
it with varying circumstances might be related, although
it can gladly be said that the irrevocable
divorce is not of such frequent occurrence as the
revocable.</p>

<p>Some incidents will illustrate the various circumstances
which cause divorce or are excuses for it.</p>

<p>Abraham, the carpenter, came to his employer
one day asking for an advance of wages. "Why?"
was asked. "I am going to get married," he said,
"and it costs much money." Then he proceeded to
relate his domestic troubles, how he had lived with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>his one wife sixteen years, explaining that he deserved
much credit for doing so, seeing that his
father during his lifetime had indulged in thirty-nine
wives, but that he had come to the point where he
must divorce this wife as she really did talk too
much, so of course he would have to marry another.</p>

<p>A happy young mother had one little son whom
she loved dearly. He was accidentally burned to
death. The poor grief-stricken mother mourned
and wept so much and so long that she became nearly
blind. Because she had no more children, her husband
divorced her. In time she talked of marrying
again. The missionary who had visited her often
and comforted her in her sorrow, remonstrated on
the grounds of her former experience. She answered
by saying, "A divorced woman must either
marry again or else live a life of sin."</p>

<p>A poor little child-wife received such injuries at
the birth of her first child because of the ignorance
of those who attended her at the time that she became
an invalid, consequently her husband divorced
her. She heard of the Mission Hospital, where she
might receive kindly treatment. She was admitted
and cured by an operation. Her husband then restored
her to his loving heart and home.</p>

<p>In a certain town there was a little family where
there seemed to be plenty of conjugal happiness in
spite of so much that is often said about the impossibility
of such a thing in a Moslem family. The
little wife was beautiful, bright, and intelligent, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>ing
fairly well educated; and was able to make her
house into something like a real home. They were
blessed with a family of interesting and promising
children. The father was wont to boast that he a
Mohammedan could verify the fact that such a thing
as a perfect home could exist under Islamic conditions.
But temptation came his way. He divorced
his beautiful unoffending wife to marry the temptress,
who though rich and of a high family (which
was her recommendation and considered sufficient
excuse for his base action), was ignorant and ugly,
the only thing which seemed to give him any pangs
of regret.</p>

<p>There was a man who was fairly well-to-do and
was considered by his neighbors as being very respectable.
The first wife was a very nice woman
but had no son, so her husband divorced her and
married a second. Still there was no son, so he
married a third. It was believed he did not really
divorce the second wife, but pretended to do so to
please the third, who would not consent to being one
of two wives. After a while a son was born to the
third, and so his first wife was brought back to the
house as nurse to the child. She was the most ladylike
of the three wives, but she had to carry the baby
and walk behind the mother like a servant. When
the baby died the parents quarrelled. Number three
left the house and went into the country. The husband
at once brought back number two, whereupon
number three returned in a rage and number two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>was turned out of the house. On the next quarrel
with number three the man married a fourth time&mdash;a
girl younger than his daughter by his first wife.
About this time he met the Bible woman in the street
and asked her why she did not visit his house as
usual. She replied, "I do not come because I never
know which lady to ask for."</p>

<p>The house of Ali might be supposed to be rather
a religious one, for the mother of the family has
performed the pilgrimage to Mecca and one of the
sons is a howling dervish. Here we were introduced
to a young bride, wife of a brother of the
dervish. Calling again a few months later we found
another bride, the one we had seen on our former
visit having been divorced. The third time we went
the first wife was there again and the second had
been divorced. The woman had been married to
another man and divorced by him during the short
time of separation from the first husband, and when
the latter wished to have her back her parents could
not agree about allowing the marriage and quarrelled
so much that they divorced each other! The time
occupied by these proceedings was between a year
and eighteen months. Here were six persons concerned,
and four marriages and four divorces had
taken place. A baby had arrived on the scene, but
its parentage was a mystery in the mix-up.</p>

<p>It is quite usual for a woman to be divorced before
the birth of her first child, and we could not but
feel sympathy with the poor young mother who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>under such circumstances called her baby "Vengeance."</p>

<p>Love, the best and most holy of human joys, has
been almost strangled to death in Egypt by the institution
of divorce, and the family can seldom be
considered a community of common interest. As
one woman was heard to say, "We go on the principle
of trying to pluck or fleece our husbands all
we can while we have the chance, since we never
know how soon we may be divorced."</p>

<p>It has been said that the character of a nation
cannot rise above the character of its women. What
can be expected of a nation when hate and jealousy
are the ruling passions of its women, of its
mothers who nurture and train up its young!</p>

<p>The question has been asked what is the condition
of the children of divorced parents. According
to the law the mother is given an allowance by
her former husband on which to bring up their
children to a certain age; then they are his. If they
are girls they often are allowed to become servants
to the mother's successor, although there are fathers
who do have enough natural affection to give the
daughters of a former wife the proper place in the
house. The allowance given a divorced woman
when she has children is most often a mere pittance
and too often she never gets one at all. She marries
again and the children live with grandparents
or other near relations or even alternate between the
houses of the remarried father and mother, thus be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>coming
mere little street waifs who have no definite
abiding place. They certainly do suffer from neglect,
but seldom are they victims of deliberate cruelty,
although such cases are not unheard of.</p>

<p>The distressing screams of a child once attracted
the attention of a family; on investigation it was
discovered that the Mohammedan neighbor, who
had just brought home a new wife encumbered with
her little four-year-old daughter, had been cruelly
ill-treating the little mite by shutting her in a dark
cellar for hours at a time.</p>

<p>The moral effect of divorce on the children is very
bad. They often seem to have an inborn passion of
hatred and jealousy. The head mistress of a school
for girls said she had often noticed how little gentle
affection and love seemed to exist between Mohammedan
sisters. These passions are also trained into
them, for they constantly hear their parents spoken
against and see the jealousy that exists between their
mothers and the wives who have supplanted them.</p>

<p>The children of divorced parents, being neglected
and not having any settled home, generally grow up
in ignorance, because they do not stay long enough
in one place to go to school regularly. A school was
established in a Mohammedan quarter of a large city
with a view to reaching the people in that district, but
they were of a class whose social system was in
such a constant state of upheaval by divorcing and
marrying new wives that it was quite impossible to
keep the children in school long enough at a time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>to make any impression upon them. When asked
why a certain Zeinab had not put in her appearance,
"Oh, she has gone to see her mother who lives across
the canal."&mdash;"Where is Tantaweyah to-day?"&mdash;"Gone
to stay with her father awhile in another village."&mdash;"What
can be the matter with Kaleela?" the
teacher asks. She knew Kaleela loved school and
would not stay away without an excuse, and she
knew that her father wanted her to stay in school,
but she had a suspicion that the new wife at home
had been the means of putting a stop to Kaleela's
schooldays. Her suspicion was true, for the new
wife's new baby required a nurse.</p>

<p>The institution of polygamy like that of divorce
is a natural consequence of the strict seclusion of
woman, for it would be unfair to a man to be put
under the necessity of taking a wife he had never
seen without allowing him some license should he be
disappointed in her. In fact, polygamy was the
original institution, a relic of the ancient and more
barbarous times, Jewish as well as Heathen. By
making polygamy a religious institution, the Prophet
preserved a relic of barbarism.</p>

<p>Yet even among Mohammedans polygamy is a
dying institution. Its death-blow has been struck
because educated Moslems are beginning to be
ashamed of it and doctors of Mohammedan law are
beginning to interpret the law to mean that Mohammed
allowed a man to have four wives on the
condition that he could treat all alike; and since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>human nature makes that condition next to an impossibility
therefore Mohammed meant for a man
to have only one wife! Many educated Mohammedans
in Egypt are taking this position. Among
the middle classes the difficulty of supporting more
than one wife at a time is decreasing polygamy.
But by no means is polygamy an unheard-of thing,
even if it is going out of fashion. Fashion is always
slow in reaching the country places, and it seems to
be in the country villages that polygamy seems to be
more generally practised. Two brothers, representative
country-men, wealthy and conservative, were
known to have very extensive harems, each one having
twenty-four wives and concubines.</p>

<p>Many fruitless attempts have been made to defend
polygamy and to defend the prophet of Islam
for preserving it, but, as a careful student of social
and moral ethics has said, "To an ideal love, polygamy
is abhorrent and impossible," and when ideal
love is impossible to the wife's heart she is degraded
because the passions of hate and jealousy will quickly
and surely take its place.</p>

<p>The Arabic word which is applied to a rival wife
is "durrah," the root meaning of which is "to injure,"
"to harm." This appellation certainly shows
that the fellow-wives are not expected to be on
terms of amity with each other.</p>

<p>The most common excuse for taking a second
wife "over the head" of the first wife, as expressed
in Arabic, is that she has failed to present her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>husband with a son. To die without a son would
be a great disgrace, so he takes his second wife. A
well-educated, pleasant-spoken Moslem sheikh, who
was teaching some new missionaries the Arabic language,
was just on the point of marrying. Being
much interested in the young man, one of the missionaries
took occasion to impress upon him some
of his moral duties toward his new wife. Among
them that he should never take another during her
lifetime. "Yes, honorable lady, I promise to do
as you say if God is willing and she presents me
with a son, otherwise against my will I must take a
second."</p>

<p>A missionary lady and a Bible woman were making
some house-to-house visits in a little country
village. As they were going through the street two
smiling-faced women standing together in the door
of their hut pressed them to enter and pay them a
visit, too. In the course of the conversation it turned
out that they were fellow-wives. "Have you any
children?" was asked of the older. "No, neither
has she," was the quick response indicating her rival
with a nod of her head. Their common disappointment
in not having any children seemed to draw
them together and they seemed more like sisters than
rival wives, but if one had a child and the other
not there would have been some quarrelling and
trouble.</p>

<p>As can be quite easily understood it is rarely
possible for fellow-wives to live together in the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>house. In one village there were two houses quite
near each other. One was known as the "house
of Hassan"; the other as the "little house of Hassan."
The former is the family house, and the other
is hired by one of the sons for his second wife, the
first wife being in the larger dwelling. The quarrels
are so incessant that it is difficult for any one to
be friendly with both parties, and the second wife is
ruining her health with inordinate smoking "to kill
thought." She seems very lonely and dull, but says
the arrangement is good, for when her husband is
vexed with her he goes to the other house, and when
vexed in the other house he comes to her, and she
added, "If we lived together and he were vexed with
both at once, he would have to sleep in a hotel!"</p>

<p>A Bible woman was wont to visit two young
women who lived in a large apartment house, on
different floors one just above the other. At first
they were believed to be the wives of brothers, but
they were so much at variance with each other that
neither would enter the apartment of the other, so
had to be taught and read to separately, much to the
inconvenience of the teacher, who could not understand
why two sisters-in-law, as she thought, could
not meet together to read. She soon discovered
that they were both wives of one man and that jealousy
was the cause of the disagreement.</p>

<p>Child-marriages have always been considered one
of the curses of the East. In Egypt thirteen is
about the average age at which the girls are mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>ried,
but one is constantly meeting with cases of
marriage at a much earlier age. A woman of
twenty-five, prematurely old, seemed to take great
delight in telling of her marriage when she was
only seven years old, about as far back as she could
remember. Another often tells the story how she
escaped being married when she was only eight
years old. The guests were all assembled, the
elaborate supper had been enjoyed by all, the dancing
women had been more than usually entertaining;
the time for the bridal procession came around,
but where was the bride? Her father searched all
through the house for her. At last he found her
lying asleep in the ashes in the kitchen. His father
heart was touched and he said to those who followed
him, "See that baby there asleep! Is it right
to marry her?" At the risk of bringing great disgrace
upon himself, he then and there stopped the
marriage and the next day started her off to school.
This custom of child-marriage is one of the very
fruitful causes of the ignorance of the women.</p>

<p>Ignorance and superstition always go hand in
hand and they jointly are both a cause and an effect
of the degradation of women in Egypt. Superstition
might almost be called the religion of
feminine Egypt. The people have many curious
beliefs about the influence of the "evil eye" and as
many curious charms to protect them from this influence.
Many mothers will not wash their children
for fear they may be made attractive and thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>fall under the influence of the evil eye. One woman
never compliments another woman's child for the
same reason. Two women were companions in
travel on the train; by way of introducing the conversation,
one said to the other, "What is that ugly
thing black as tar in your arms?" The other smiling
held out her little baby. "Ugh! how ugly!"
said the first woman. "Is it a boy or a girl?"&mdash;"A
girl," said the mother, but it was quite understood
that it was a boy. Boys on account of the
very high premium put upon them in Egypt are
considered to be very much subject to the influence
of the "evil eye," so often he is dressed as a
girl and called by a girl's name till he reaches the
age when he rebels.</p>

<p>The social evils of Egypt are endless, but there is
a hope of better things for the future. One of the
characteristics of the "New Egypt" is a reaching
out after higher ideals. The ideal of the marriage
relation is rising, the educated young Egyptian is
beginning to claim his right to choose his own
bride, thus making the marriage relation more stable
because the grounds of compatibility are surer.
With this change of ideas on the marriage question
and because an educated man would rather choose
an educated wife, there is a growing demand for
female education.</p>

<p>The evangelical community has the reputation of
being the best educated class of people in Egypt.
The last census of all Egypt showed that only forty-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>eight
in one thousand could read. A special census
of the native evangelical community showed that
three hundred and sixty-five in one thousand could
read. The census also brought out the fact that in
the evangelical community female education has
taken a great step in advance, showing that while
in all Egypt only six women in one thousand could
read, in the evangelical community two hundred in
one thousand could read.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to take a peep into some
of the homes of these representative Christian
women and see for ourselves how a Christian education
has developed those wives and mothers into true
home-makers. First let us get acquainted with the
dear old grandmother who has just been on a visit to
her son and his family who live in our city. She
and her son have come to make us a farewell visit
before she leaves for her native town. Her feeble
voice, her slow step, her dimmed sight, the appealing
marks of old age interest us in her. The goodbye
kiss and an affectionate pat from her withered
old hand draw our hearts to her, the tender filial
light in the eyes of her son tells us that this gentle
little old lady has been a power for good. After
they leave we learn in conversation with those who
know the story of her life that she is one of the
faithful mothers who has endured much persecution,
separation from friends, leaving a home of
wealth and influence for one of poverty all for the
sake of Christ. The best commentary on her life is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>the beautiful Christian home of this son, where his
sweet ladylike little wife presides over their family
of clean, well-ordered children with all the gentle
dignity of a real queen. We are perfectly at home
with them, for we see nothing but what accords with
our ideal of a real home. Without any previous information
it would be easy to know that this home is
a Bethel where Christ delights to dwell.</p>

<p>Let us go to a distant town far up the river and
visit an old couple who have spent many years in
God's service. Their lives are a perfect illustration
of what Christ can do for a life. Reared under all
the tenets and principles of Islam and not being converted
to Christianity till they were mature in years,
it might be doubted whether a complete change could
be wrought in their lives. It did not come all at
once, God works out some of His greatest changes in
lives slowly and quietly, a "growing up unto Him
in all things." The story of the growth of these
two followers of Christ is long and interesting. It
is enough to know that they have attained to that
point where they can truly be called a "holy temple
in the Lord." Their home is a model of Christian
happiness where "cleanliness and godliness" dwell
together. Their lives are lives of service for their
Master. The daughter of this home, a woman of
rare beauty, carefully brought up and well educated,
is one who although yet young in years has had a
marked influence for good in Egypt, first as a teacher
in a large girls' school, then as the honored and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>much loved wife of the pastor of a flourishing
evangelical church. To visit her in her home, to
see her in the midst of her little sons and daughters,
to join with the family in the evening meal which
has been prepared by her own hands, to hear her
talk of her work among the women in her husband's
large congregation makes one reverently breathe a
prayer of thanksgiving to God that He has let us
have a glimpse of the possibilities of Egyptian
womanhood.</p>

<p>All up and down the valley of the Nile can be
found women from this representative two hundred
in different stations of life; and each one filling in
a womanly way her position. Generally she is a
wife and mother, but a true home-maker whether
she be the wife of a noble or a peasant. Sometimes
she is a servant, faithful, honest, and helpful; often
she is a teacher throwing out great circles of influence,
which are widening out till thousands of
Egyptian women will be reached. Sometimes she
is a humble soul who gives herself over entirely to
the service of her Master.</p>

<p>Such a one was Safsaf, converted at the clinic.
Her husband had cast her off because she was nearly
blind. Her great desire was to learn to read. She
was presented with a primer and New Testament
when she returned to her village after being in the
hospital three months. Who would teach her to
read? She begged a lesson at every opportunity
from those in her village who had a little learning.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>No one imagined that she was such an earnest Christian
till she soon mastered the reading and after
going through the New Testament three times, she
began to teach the very ones who had taught her,
rebuking them for their sins. They cursed her, saying,
"Did we teach you so that you would accuse
us!" Her old father learned the truth through her
teaching. He then arranged their little hut so that
she might hold meetings for women. Her influence
among the women and children was wonderful and
everybody began to recognize it. Through her
efforts a boys' school was started and a capable
teacher was secured. The greatest desire of her
heart was to have the ministrations of an evangelist
in her village. She mustered up courage to go to
the meeting of Presbytery and present the request.
This was a daring and unheard-of thing for an
Egyptian woman to do. But the members of Presbytery
were much affected by her pleading and
granted her request. The next thing was to get a
church; she gave her own little bit of ground, her
all, then begged money to build the church on it.
In addition to these wider interests, she faithfully
and lovingly fulfilled home duties. Her sister, an
ignorant, selfish, and very superstitious woman, was
her great trial. This sister became ill, so she took
her to the hospital. The doctors told her there was
no hope. She begged them to allow her to remain.
Safsaf spent days and nights praying for her sister's
recovery. She began to mend, and the prayers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>of her devoted sister at her bedside that she might
be restored so as to have an opportunity to learn
of God and become a converted soul, led her to
accept Christ as her Saviour.</p>

<p>The life of this humble, quiet-spoken, earnest-hearted,
patient, loving woman, who lives close to
Christ, is exercising an influence in her native village
which even men wonder at, but only God knows how
far-reaching it is.</p>

<p>The possibilities of the Egyptian women are great
either for good or for evil.</p>

<p>It is said that Ismail Pasha, the grandfather of the
present Khedive, who in his day ruled Egypt with
a tyrant's hand, was himself ruled by a woman. His
mother, a woman of strong character, was the power
behind the throne. Much has been said about the
downtrodden condition of Egyptian women, and
none too much. Islam puts its heel on the neck of
woman. It debases and despises her. But there is
another side to the picture. Woman was born an
invincible spirit, which even the yoke of Islam has
not been able to crush. And in Egypt scarcely less
than in lands where she is more honored, she exercises
a sway that can neither be denied or despised.
The lords of creation&mdash;and that the men of Egypt
feel themselves decidedly to be&mdash;yield to their
women far more than a casual observer or even
they themselves imagine.</p>

<p>An illustration of this is seen in connection with
the mourning customs. The government, and in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>case of the Copts, the Church also, has interfered
to break up the violent mourning of the women at
the time of deaths. Yet very little have they
yielded.</p>

<p>This is only one of a thousand instances in which,
despite all restrictions, they do as they please. But
their influence reaches to far deeper things. They
cling to superstitions and a false faith with far more
tenacity than do the men. They bring up their children
in the same way. It is they who make the
marriages for their sons; and they rule their
daughters-in-law. They keep many a man from acting
up to his religious convictions, and drag many
a one back to the denial of his faith. They submit
in many things; they are weaker, but it is true that
work for women lies at the very foundation of mission
work. An Egyptian once said in answer to a
statement that the primary object of Mission schools
for girls was to lead them to Christ, "If you get the
girls for Christ, you get Egypt for Christ."</p>

<p>What are the women like? Are they pretty?
How do they bring up their children? How do
they keep their homes? Do you like them? Are
they lovable?</p>

<p>Such are a few of the many questions which are
put to the traveller and resident in Egypt, by those
interested, for various reasons, in the land and its
people.</p>

<p>How differently these questions can be answered.
The ordinary tourist sees the black-robed figures
(with features invisible except for two eyes peering
over a black crape veil) walking in the streets
of the cities, or driving sitting huddled together on
karros,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and he remarks on the discomfort of the
costume and the cleverness with which they succeed
in balancing themselves on the jolting springless
carts. Or again he sees ladies of the upper class
driving in their carriages and motor broughams,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>wearing indeed the inevitable "habarah" and veil,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
but the former cut so as to well expose the upper
part of the person which is clothed in rich satins and
adorned with sparkling jewels, and the latter made
in such fine white chiffon and hung so loosely over
the lower part of the face only, that the features
are distinctly visible; and he marks with a smile the
effort made by woman to emancipate herself from
customs which deny her the prerogative of attracting
admiration to herself.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Again, perchance, he sees the "fellahah" carrying
her water jar with ease and grace along some rough
uneven track; or, may be, in company with others
bearing with agility and strength loads of mud and
brick to the builders, measuring her steps and actions
to the music of some native chant; and he is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>impressed with the idea of her bright existence and
her powers of perfect enjoyment.</p>

<p>Again he sees her, whether in city or village alike,
following the bier which is carrying all that is left
of one who may or may not have been dear to her,
and he hears the shrill death wail, and he notes
either the bitterness of hopeless sorrow, or the hollowness
of a make-belief grief; and he is struck with
the demonstrativeness of the women and the peculiarity
of the scene, and will try to get a snap-shot
of it on his kodak, and then he passes on to things
of other interest. Thus the tourist gets to know
something of the women, it is true, but all that lies
behind these outside scenes is closed to him, and
rarely known.</p>

<p>To the British resident the Egyptian woman is
usually less interesting than to the tourist. The novelty
of her peculiarities and picturesqueness has worn
off, and between her and her more fortunate sisters
of the West there is a great gulf fixed. Very rarely
is an attempt made to bridge this gulf; language
and customs apparently form an impassable barrier,
and though many English ladies live in Egypt for
years, they never enter an Egyptian house, or speak
to an Egyptian woman.</p>

<p>It is therefore left to the Christian missionary to
know&mdash;and to know with an ever widening knowledge&mdash;what
are the disabilities and what the capabilities
as well as possibilities of these daughters of
Hagar.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<p>A woman's life may truly be said to have its
commencement in betrothal. Before then she is
a child, and the days of her childhood are usually
spent without any form of restraint whatever.
Most of her time, even if she be the daughter of quite
well-to-do people, is often spent playing in the
streets, where she learns much that is evil and little
that is good. The one great reason which many
parents give who wish to put their children to school
is, "to keep her out of the street, where she plays in
the dirt and learns bad language." But whether she
goes to school or not the life of a little girl except
in school hours is a perfectly free, untrained life in
which she learns no morality, not even obedience to
her parents. If she does obey them it is from abject
fear of punishment, when disobedience would
inevitably mean a severe beating. Between the ages
of ten to fifteen, usually about twelve and often
earlier, the little girl is betrothed and then confinement
to the house begins. In one hour her life is
changed, no more playing about in the street and
acting upon the impulse of her own sweet will, no
more for her the child's delight of spending her
millième or two at the costermonger's cart and then
sitting in the gutter to eat her purchase with face
and hands begrimed with dirt; no more for her the
joy of paddling in the mud by the street pump, and
climbing and clambering about wherever she can
with difficulty get. No, she is betrothed now, and
her childhood and girlhood are over. Instead of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>freedom and liberty, come confinement and restraint.
She is not now allowed out of doors except
on rare occasions and then in company with older
women, and her movements are hampered by her
being enveloped in "habarah" and "veil."</p>

<p>Still she has for a time some little comfort in being
the important person of the community. She is
the bride-elect and there is some excitement in seeing
the new "galibeeyahs"<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> and articles of furniture
which are to become her own special property. But
then, after a few short months, sometimes weeks,
the fatal wedding day arrives, when the child-bride
is taken away from her mother and becomes the
absolute possession of a man she has often never
seen, and knows nothing about. Her woman's life
is begun in earnest, and in very stern reality she
learns what it is to be in subjection, she learns by
bitter experience that she has no power now to do
what she likes, and that she is subservient to another.</p>

<p>Her husband may be kind to her, and in many
cases is; but in any case she is his slave and utterly
dependent on the caprice of his nature. If she herself
is fortunate enough to have a man who treats
her humanely there are dozens of others living in
her quarter who come to see her, who are objects
of cruelty and malevolence; and so her mind is fed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>with histories of intrigue and divorce, of injustice
and retaliation, and of unwritten scandal and sin;
until she too, alas! becomes contaminated, and often
brings down upon herself the just wrath and harshness
of one who might have been good to her. History
repeats itself: in nine cases out of ten, she can
add her tale of woe to the rest.</p>

<p>She bears her children and nurses them, thankful
if they chance to be boys; she has no heart nor ability
to teach or train them; or joy in keeping them
clean and pretty;&mdash;she loses two, three, or more in
infancy; those who are strong survive and until they
are two or three years old, take her place in the
streets, where the open-air life and exercise become
their physical salvation.</p>

<p>When she is over twenty, she in her turn becomes
an elder woman and is to be seen, usually with a
young baby in her arms, walking in the streets as
she goes the round of seeing her friends, wailing
with the mourners at the house of death, weekly
visiting the graves of her own or her husband's
relatives, and joining in the wedding festivities of
those who are going to follow in her train.</p>

<p>What wonder that the Moslem man often cries
despairingly: "Our women are all brutish," and has
not an atom of respect for her in his heart. In the
few cases where a Moslem man speaks well of his
wife, and calls her "a good woman," he almost invariably
attributes her being so to his own foresight,
and diligent insistence in keeping her wholly under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>his control, limiting those who come to the house,
and not letting her go out of the house even after
she has become an elder woman. Between thirty-five
and forty she is an old woman with grandchildren,
and her life quietly goes down to the
grave with all the light and joy long since gone out
of it, and with a dark and hopeless future before it.
A few illustrations from the writer's personal
knowledge will not perhaps be out of place here.</p>

<p>Fatimah had been a day pupil in a mission school
for four years. She could read and write well, and
sew, and do fancy work. Her father was dead, her
brother, for some business expedient, arranged a
marriage for her, when she was thirteen, with an
old man who had already sons and daughters much
older than herself.</p>

<p>He was a head man in his village and lived some
distance from Fatimah's home. "Do you think it
will be a good thing for Fatimah?" said I to the
mother. "What are we to do?" was the reply;
"they say he is kind; and far better to marry her to
him than to a young man who will only ill-treat
and beat her; we are very poor and cannot afford to
get a really respectable young man."</p>

<p>The marriage took place, within two months
Fatimah had returned home but was induced to go
back again, this was repeated twice and on returning
home the third time, she made up her mind to
get her husband to permanently divorce her. Her
mother of course abetted her, and a woman (as pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>ment
for a piece of fancy work she had asked Fatimah
to do for her) promised to bring about the
divorce by some plan of intrigue which she would
arrange.</p>

<p>Fatimah's life is blighted; the best that one can
hope for is re-marriage to a poor but respectable
man, and to go through her life with him; but the
probabilities are she will be married and divorced
time after time, and each time sink lower in the
social scale. She is not yet fifteen years old.</p>

<p>Aneesah was a little girl of nine, frail and delicate-looking,
and an only child and much petted, but
often she seemed possessed by the devil so naughty
was her conduct. At such times her mother would
take her and tie her up, then beat her unmercifully,
until the neighbors, hearing the child's screams,
would come to the rescue and force the mother to
desist. The mother has herself shown me the
marks of her own teeth in the flesh of her child's
arms, where she has bitten her in order to drive
the devil out of her. What is likely to be the future
of that child? One shudders to think of it.</p>

<p>Many a time in visiting among the very poor I
have sat with the women in an open court, which is
like a small yard in the middle of several houses, in
which several families own one, two, or three rooms.
In the court there may be a dozen or more women,
unwashed, uncombed, untidy to a degree; some
bread-making, some washing, others seated nursing
their babies:&mdash;babies who are as sick and unhealthy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>as they can possibly be, their bodies ingrained with
dirt, their heads encrusted with sores and filth, their
eyes inflamed and uncleansed, their garments smelling,
and one and all looking thoroughly ill and
wretched. It is the rarest thing to see a healthy-looking
baby.</p>

<p>As I have sat amongst them and talked with
them, I have tried to reason with them and point
out the advantages of cleanliness and industry; all
admit that I am right and that our habits are better
than theirs, yet none have the heart or the energy or
the character to break away from their customs and
their innate laziness and to rise up and be women.</p>

<p>Yet one can hardly wonder at their condition,
what chances have they had? Married at ten or
eleven, untrained and untaught, many of them not
knowing how to hold a needle, or make the simplest
garment; still in their teens with two or three children
to burden them, whom they long to see big
enough to turn out into the streets and play as they
did before them. Their only interest in life, each
other's family brawls and scandals; their health undermined
by close confinement and want of exercise,
is it a wonder that they sink into a state of callousness
and indifference about everything?</p>

<p>I have seen a bright-spirited, energetic, laughing,
romping girl of eleven, turned in one year into a
miserable, lazy, dull, inert woman with her beauty
and health gone, and looking nearer thirty than
thirteen. One often does not wonder at such a con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>dition
of things, rather does one wonder when the
reverse prevails, and one is able to realize their possibilities
in spite of all their drawbacks. I know of
women, though they are but very few, equally poor
and unfavored as those I have described, who can
be found sitting in their own little rooms, their
younger children with them, holding themselves
aloof from the usual gossip, their rooms swept,
themselves clean and tidy, their babies, though not
ideal, comparing favorably with the others; their
one apparent trouble, the elder children whom they
do not know how to train and whom they cannot
keep out of the streets; unless indeed there chance
to be a mission school in the near neighborhood.</p>

<p>The same state of things pervades all classes of
society, though in the middle and upper classes the
Moslems are usually very cleanly both in their persons
and in their homes, but the majority of the
women are in the same low degraded moral state.
Life in the harems is spent in smoking and idle gossip,
and things far worse; the wife and mother
there, no less than among the poorer classes, has
no idea of responsibility. She is frequently unable
either to sew, read, or write, and leaves her children
to the care of dependents. Her life is merely an
animal life; she is but a necessary article for use in
her husband's household.</p>

<p>A wealthy merchant who has had several wives
keeps one in a beautiful house with every comfort,
another wife of the same man is left to live where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>she can with the pittance of something like three
pence per day. This is what the Moslem faith
allows.</p>

<p>It has been well said "a nation cannot rise above
the level of its women," and this is painfully illustrated
in Egypt and in all other lands where the
faith of Islam holds sway. Much is being done to
improve the social conditions of the people of Egypt,
but the real sore remains untouched so long as the
teaching of the Koran with regard to the position of
women remains in vogue.</p>

<p>There are many Mohammedan gentlemen who
would fain see a better state of things, and who, like
the late Mr. Justice Budrudin Tyabji, of Madras,
devote their efforts to the amelioration of the backward
position of their brethren in the faith, and desire
especially the "mitigation and ultimate removal
of paralyzing social customs, such as the seclusion
of women." But their efforts are unavailing so
long as they remain adherents of the Moslem faith,
for in obedience to the Koran they can adopt no
other course than the present one.</p>

<p>Let them substitute for the Koran the teaching of
the Christian faith, the faith which alone gives
woman her rightful position, and they will find that
she can be a mighty influence for good in the social
life of the nation. Let her take the place ordained
for her by the Great Creator as the "helpmeet" to
man, let her fulfil her mission in the world, laid
down in the teaching of the New Testament, to love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>and influence, to cheer and strengthen, to pour out
her life in the devotion of love and self-sacrifice,
whether as daughter and sister, or wife and mother;
then will the women of Egypt be clothed with
"strength and honor" and then will the daughters
of Hagar put on the robe of chastity and the
"adornment of a meek and quiet spirit."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i11">"Chastity&mdash;<br /></span>

The poorer women make it of two lengths of material two
metres long, joined together on the selvedge. The ends of
one breadth are sewn up and form the skirt, while the upper
breadth is left to pass over the head and fold over the upper
part of the person like a shawl. The richer, from the middle
class upwards, sew the lower breadth into a band forming a
skirt, and the upper breadth is cut smaller to form only a
cape fastened on to the waist band at the back, coming up
over the head, falling by rights over the whole upper part of
the body, but frequently cut so as to scarcely reach the elbow.
The latter is worn by the poorer classes; and by many of the
older women of the better class it is made of black crape and
is tied over the face from just below the eyes and extends to
below the waist; by the upper classes and more wealthy it
was made in fine white muslin but sufficient to disguise the
features. Now it is frequently made in chiffon.</p></div>

<h2>BEHIND THE OPENING DOOR IN TUNIS</h2>


<p>The lot of a Tunisian woman is probably a
brighter one than that of many of her Moslem sisters
who have not the privilege of living under the
enlightened rule of a European government.</p>

<p>It is not possible for her, under existing circumstances,
to have the perfect liberty of European
women, but should justice not be granted by an
Arab tribunal, she has always the right of appeal to
the French authorities, who take care to see that
the laws are rightly administered.</p>

<p>The English-speaking race, accustomed to greater
freedom for its women than any other on the face of
the earth perhaps, would find it hard to be shut up
in an Arab house, taking no long country walks,
joining in no outdoor games, knowing nothing of
the pleasures of shopping expeditions, having no
literary pursuits, and meeting no men outside the
circle of their relatives; and indeed it is a sadly
narrow life. But we must remember that our Moslem
sisters have never known anything better, and
the majority are perfectly contented with things as
they are. To thoroughly appreciate and make a
right use of liberty, one must be trained, there must
be education to meet its responsibilities, and without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>this its effects would be disastrous. To an Arab
lady who never goes out otherwise than closely
veiled, it would be a far greater trial to walk
through the streets with face exposed, than to the
European to cover herself.</p>

<p>Much has been said about the hardships of the
woman's being locked in during her husband's absence
from the house. This is not infrequent and
does appear somewhat prison-like; but it is often
done solely as a protection. I knew one woman who
preferred to be thus locked in, but arranged with
her husband that on the days of my visits the key
should not be turned on her. And the doors of
Arab houses are always so constructed that, even
when locked, they can be opened from inside on an
emergency though they cannot be reclosed without
the key.</p>

<p>When I came to this country some twelve years
ago, the thing that most struck me in visiting Arab
houses was the cheerfulness and even gaiety of the
women. I had a preconceived picture in my mind
of poor creatures sitting within prison walls, pining
to get out, and in utter misery.</p>

<p>Nothing of the kind! What did I find? Laughter,
chatter, the distraction of periodic visits to saints'
tombs, or that centre of social intercourse&mdash;the
bath. Old women, the scandal-mongers of the
neighborhood, go round to retail their news. (And
it will be allowed that even in England there are
many who take a deeper interest in the doings of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>their neighbors than in more elevated topics of conversation.)</p>

<p>Here Jewesses, spreading out their pretty, silken
goods to tempt purchasers, or neighbors who had
"dropped in" by way of the roof for a gossip, not
over a dish of tea, but a cup of black coffee. There
Arab women, much like children, quickly shaking
off little troubles and meeting greater trials with the
resignation of fatalism, which finds comfort in the
magic word, "Maktoob" (It is decreed), in a manner
incomprehensible to the Western mind.</p>

<p>Is it surprising that I almost accused my fellow-missionaries
of misrepresenting the home life of the
people? But I only saw the surface and had not yet
probed the deep sore of Mohammedanism nor realized
the heavy burdens which its system entails.</p>

<p>Let me tell you of three of the heaviest of these
burdens: <i>Polygamy</i>, <i>Divorce</i>, and the <i>Ignorance</i>
which results from complete lack of education and
walks hand-in-hand with its twin-sister, <i>Superstition</i>.</p>

<p><i>Polygamy</i> shall be placed first, although it is not
the greatest bane of Tunisian home life. By Mohammedan
law a man is allowed four wives, but in
Tunisia, though it is by no means rare for a man to
have two, he seldom takes more than that number
at one time. Occasionally they live in separate
houses, sometimes in different towns, and may be
quite unknown to each other. A Moslem will frequently
take a second wife in the hope of having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>children, or it may be a son, the first wife being
childless.</p>

<p>In other houses one finds under the same roof
two wives of one husband, each having a large number
of children. Each wife will have two or three
maid-servants who sit with their mistresses and
mingle freely in the conversation, and, if the family
be wealthy, the elder daughters have their own special
attendants. Thus a household may contain a
large number of women who live together more or
less harmoniously, and whose numerous quarrels do
not conduce to the tranquillity of the master of the
house. But what does he care as long as he <i>is</i> master
and reigns supreme? There is probably not
much affection between him and the wife whom he
never saw before the wedding-day, but he loves his
children, being specially fond of the little ones and
showing all a father's pride in his sons. His hours
of recreation are spent at the café or the more aristocratic
rendezvous&mdash;the barber's shop&mdash;and the
charms of sweet home life he has never imagined.</p>

<p>Year by year, however, Western education is
slowly but surely telling on the Oriental mind. The
young men, trained in French schools and imbibing
modern ideas, show a strong tendency to follow the
manners and customs of their teachers, and it is at
least considered more "comme-il-faut" to take only
one wife and in some measure copy the European
"ménage."</p>

<p><i>Divorce</i> is, however, the great <i>curse</i> which blights
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>domestic happiness, and words fail me to describe
the misery it brings.</p>

<p>The Moslem population of the city of Tunis is sixty
thousand. Setting aside men and children there
remain, roughly speaking, about twenty-five thousand
women, and comparing my own experience
with that of other lady missionaries we are
agreed in affirming that the majority of these
women in the middle and lower classes have been
divorced at least once in their lives, many of them
two or three times, while some few have had a
number of husbands. In the upper class and
wealthy families divorce is not nearly so common,
and for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>I have never known a man to have thirty or
forty wives in succession as one hears of in some
Mohammedan lands. A man once told my brother-in-law
that he had been married eighteen times, and
I heard of another who had taken (the Arab expression)
twelve wives, one after another; but this
last was related with bated breath as being an unusual
and opprobrious act.</p>

<p>When a woman is divorced she returns to her
father's house and remains dependent on him until
he finds her another husband, her monetary value
being now greatly reduced. The quarrel which led
to the separation is sometimes adjusted and she
returns to her husband, but <i>never</i> if he has pronounced
the words, "Tulka be thaléthe" (Divorce
by three, or threefold). This, even though uttered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>in a moment of anger, may never be recalled, and if
he really care for his wife and wish to take her
back again, she must be married to another man
and divorced by him before she can return to her
first husband. But the laws relating to marriage,
divorce, and the guardianship of the children, would
require a volume to themselves and cannot be
entered upon here.</p>

<p>One is led to ask, what is the cause of this dark
cloud of evil which casts its terrible shadow over
so many homes?</p>

<p>No doubt it chiefly arises from the low standard
of Moslem morality and is intensified by the whole
basis of the marriage relationship.</p>

<p>Among the upper classes a girl does not often
marry till about seventeen years old, but a poorer
man is glad to get his daughters off his hands at a
much earlier age, especially if he can obtain a good
dowry in payment. The girl goes through a form
of acceptance, relying on the representations of her
relatives, which are often far from truthful. She
never sees her husband until the wedding day and
then, no matter how old, ugly, or repulsive the man
may be, it is too late to refuse; no wonder that
mutual disappointment often ensues, deepening into
strong dislike, which produces constant friction,
culminating in a violent quarrel; as in the case
of a young girl whom I knew, married to an old
man, and divorced a few years later through a
quarrel over a pound of meat.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span><br /></p>

<p><br />The history of the two little girls in the accompanying
photograph, shows clearly the contrast between
the life of an English and that of an Arab
child. It was taken about eight years ago at the
birthday party of my little niece, who had been
allowed, as a treat, to invite a number of Arab
girls to tea, and was photographed with one who
was about the same age as herself. The one, Dorothy,
is now thirteen years old and still a happy,
light-hearted schoolgirl, carefully sheltered from
all knowledge of evil. The other, Fatima, to-day,
sits in her father's house, divorced, desolate, and
soured in temper by her hard fate. And, indeed,
her story makes one's heart ache.</p>

<p>Some few months ago she was married to a
young man, who, though not yet twenty, had already
divorced his first wife. Still, Fatima's
parents considered that no drawback, since he was
in prosperous circumstances and willing to pay six
hundred francs for the charming little bride. The
marriage festivities lasted a week, friends showered
blessings upon the bride and the bridegroom, who
were mutually pleased with each other, and all
seemed to augur well for the future.</p>

<p>But, as in the old fairy story, no one had reckoned
on the machinations of the bad fairy who soon presented
herself in the form of the girl's grandmother.
The old lady strongly objected to the match on the
ground that a slur was cast on the family by Fatima's
being married before her elder sister, Hanani,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>who was not so good-looking and had consequently
been passed over by the professional matchmakers.
She vowed to separate the young couple by "working
the works of Satan" over them, which in plain
English means, exercising sorcery. But I will tell
the story as I heard it from the mother.</p>

<p>Five weeks after the wedding the old woman contrived
to steal secretly into the bride's room and
sprinkle over it a powder possessing the power of
casting an evil spell over those she wished to injure,
and, to make her work more efficacious, she
further wrapped a knife with evil charms and hid it
amongst the bridegroom's clothes. Shortly after
she met the young man, and clutching him by the
arm, her sharp eyes gleaming from between the
folds of her veil, she hissed: "Know, O man, that
I have bewitched thee and ere long thou shalt be
separated from thy bride!" On entering the house
that evening, he complained that he felt as though
in a furnace. It was a cold night and the family
were shivering, but he kept casting off one garment
after another, exclaiming that the awful heat
was unendurable and that he was surely bewitched.</p>

<p>This went on evening after evening for a whole
week until he declared that he could stand it no
longer, and could only rid himself of his sufferings
by a divorce. Before the kadi he explained that he
had nothing against the girl nor their family, who
had always treated him with great kindness, but he
was under the influence of sorcery and must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>divorced. And this statement was accepted as perfectly
reasonable. What astonished me the most
was, that the bride's parents exonerated him from
all blame. As the mother said, "I loved him as my
own son, but he could not help it." The old woman
had worked the works of Satan over him, and how
could he escape?</p>

<p>This incident shows not only the slender nature
of the marriage ties but also the immense power
which <i>superstition</i> exercises over the mind. It
seems to be part of a Moslem woman's very nature,
and largely influences all her life from the cradle
to the grave.</p>

<p>Beware, when visiting an Arab woman, of too
greatly admiring her tiny baby, however engaging
it may be! Such admiration would surely attract
"the evil eye," and then woe to the little one! The
safest course of an ignorant Roumi (Christian) is
merely to glance at her little child and say,
"Mabrouk" (May it be blest).</p>

<p>Is there illness in the house, a message is first
sent to the "degaz" (soothsayer), who writes a
magic paper, encloses it in a leather case, and sends
it to the sick one with directions to fasten it on
the head, arm, etc., according to the part affected.</p>

<p>Another favorite remedy is to pour a little water
into a basin on which passages from the Koran are
written, and then either drink or bathe with it as
the disease may appear to require.</p>

<p>These powerful remedies failing to restore health,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>the invalid is next taken to the tomb of some celebrated
"saint." There, offerings are made and
prayers recited. A favorite resort in Tunis is the
Zawia of Sidi Abdallah, situated just outside the
city wall. Here a black cock is sacrificed and a
little of its blood sprinkled on the neck, elbow, and
knee of the sufferer on whose behalf it is offered.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 594px;"><a name="Arab_Woman_Entering_Saints_Tomb" id="Arab_Woman_Entering_Saints_Tomb"></a>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">An Arab Woman Entering a Saint&#39;s Tomb (Tunis)</span></span>
</div>

<p><br />Before our house stands a Zawia (saint's tomb),
built in honor of a female saint, and at this tomb one
day stood an Arab woman, knocking gently at the
door and crying in piteous tones, "O lady! Heal
me, for I am very ill! I have giddiness in my head!
I am very weak! Do heal me!" The poor creature
calling in her ignorance on a dead saint not only
moves the heart to pity but also creates in the mind
a wonder as to who these saints may be, and what
has led to their being thus honored.</p>

<p>Let me give you a sketch of a noted dervish, or
saint, who has just passed away. I first saw Sidi
Ali Ben Jaber some years ago seated in front of a
café in the Halfouine&mdash;the quarter where the late
Bey had built him a house. By his side were native
musicians making a discordant noise while at intervals
the holy man was bellowing like a mad bull.
Securing a corner of a doorstep, I managed to peep
over the surrounding crowd and my curiosity was
rewarded by the sight of a decrepit, filthy old man,
his bald pate encircled by scant grizzled hair and
unadorned by the usual fez cap. His sole covering
was a dirty cotton shirt, open at the neck and de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>scending
no lower than the knees. But what a
shirt! As a mark of saintliness, it had not left his
body for years, but had gradually increased in thickness,
for when sufficiently caked with accumulations
of filth and snuff, a clean piece of calico had been
sewn over it. This had been covered by successive
layers as required, until it is just possible that the
initiated might have been able to determine the age
of the wearer by the concentric rings of his garment!</p>

<p>Sidi Ali was not always, however, thus seated in
state. He would, from time to time, parade the
Halfouine, stopping occasionally to demand a gift,
which was seldom refused. Stories are told of swift
judgments overtaking bold Moslems who slighted
the wish of the holy man, and equally thrilling
accounts of deliverance from peril to the Faithful
who granted his desire.</p>

<p>Sidi Ali Ben Jaber once met another Arab, Sidi
Ben Faraji, dragged him into a neighboring shop
and insisted on his buying a large and expensive
block of marble with which to embellish the
"saint's" house, for that happened to be the holy
man's craze for the time. On his way home Sidi
Ben Faraji had to pass under a bridge, which fell,
severely crushing his left arm, and now was apparent
the virtue of his gift to the holy man; for had
he refused to buy the marble as requested, the
bridge would assuredly have fallen, not on his arm
only, but on his whole body, and he would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>become a shapeless mass. Our "Halfouine saint"
was sometimes in a violent state of mind. Then,
as he approached, the butchers would quickly hide
their meat, the confectioners' display of cakes became
suddenly scanty, while other shops appeared
equally bare.</p>

<p>The "saint" might enter a shop, turn the contents
into the street, and work general havoc; the
owner not daring to say him nay, but cherishing the
hope of recompense in Heaven to atone for present
loss. In cases of illness, Sidi Ali would be taken
to the house of the sick one, and his presence was
said invariably to bring blessing and relief.</p>

<p>He is also said to have foretold the introduction
of electric trams, but this appears to have been only
thought of when they had already made their appearance
in the city.</p>

<p>For months the poor old man had been growing
feebler, and in the month of January last he passed
away. His death caused general mourning and
lamentation, many women weeping bitterly. The
corpse was escorted to the mosque and thence to the
cemetery by various sects displaying colored silk
banners, emblazoned with Koran verses. Crowds
pressed round the bier fighting for a chance of seizing
it for a moment and thus securing "merit" in
heaven, and it was only a strong force of police
which prevented the whole being upset. Fumes of
incense filled the air, dervishes swayed in their wild
chants till one and the other fell exhausted, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>when the tomb was finally reached the bier was
broken into fragments and distributed amongst
eager claimants from amongst the thirty thousand
Moslems assembled.</p>

<p>Such, dear readers, is a Moslem saint, and their
name is legion. It is by the intercession of such
as these that the superstitious hope to obtain earthly
and heavenly benefits, and it is at the shrines of
such as these that the poor Moslem women come, in
the dark days of trouble, to pour out their hearts
and seek for help and blessing.</p>

<p>Some time ago one of my schoolgirls asked me
to go and see her sister, who had been brought
from a neighboring village seriously ill. On reaching
the house I found a young woman of about
eighteen stretched on a mattress on the floor, and
sitting by her side, her husband, who was at least
fifty years of age. The poor creature was in great
suffering and evidently too ill for any simple remedy,
so I called in the help of a French lady doctor,
who kindly came and prescribed for her.</p>

<p>On going to the house next day, great was my
surprise to find that the medicine ordered had not
been given, and the surprise gave place to indignation
when I discovered that the family firmly believed
that the whole trouble was caused by an evil
spirit which had taken possession of the young wife,
and that the black sheep, tied up in the courtyard,
had been placed there in the hope that the demon
would prefer to inhabit the body of the animal and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>might thus be induced to leave its present abode.
Poor young thing! She died not long after, but her
friends to this day believe that they did all in their
power to help her, and her death could not have
been averted since it was surely <i>decreed</i>.</p>

<p>The veil that shrouds the Moslem home life in
Tunis has been raised and my readers have had a
peep at its sadder side, but it is only a peep! The
farther one penetrates the more intolerable its noisome
atmosphere becomes. Deceit and lying are so
prevalent that a mother questions the simplest statements
of her own son, and I have seen a mistress
insist on a servant swearing on the Koran before
she would accept his word. Demoralizing conversation
is freely indulged in before the children, till
their minds become depraved to such an extent that
in our school we could not allow the girls to tell
each other stories or even ask riddles because of
their indecent character; and bad language, even
from the little ones, was a thing with which we constantly
had to contend.</p>

<p>And now we, to whom God has given so much
light and so many privileges, are brought face to
face with the problem, What can be done to help
our Mohammedan sisters to lift the burdens which
mar the happiness of so many lives?</p>

<p>In the first place it seems to me a necessity that
the <i>man's</i> eyes should be opened to see the true condition
of affairs from a Western, or better still
a <i>Christian</i>, standpoint, and should realize the larger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>amount of domestic happiness he, himself, is losing.
And this may be done by education and the free
intercourse with Christian families, which will give
him an insight into the joys of their home circles.</p>

<p>As was before hinted, European education is already
cultivating the intelligence of the upper
classes and slowly extending its leavening influence
among the masses. There is an increasing desire,
not only that the boys should receive a good French
education, but that the girls should share its benefits
too. Tennyson's words in the mouth of King
Arthur have a new significance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The old order changeth, giving place to new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And God fulfils Himself in many ways."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But this change cannot be accomplished in a day,
nor without a struggle between the old and new systems.
This may be illustrated by an amusing scene
I once witnessed.</p>

<p>I was one day sitting in the house of a wealthy
Arab whose mind had been enlarged by travelling
in many lands. His eldest daughter was one of the
very few Arab girls I have met who could read and
write Arabic beautifully. I was accustomed to give
her French lessons, and she was at that moment in
the opposite room across the courtyard, taking a
lesson from a Jewish music master on a new piano
lately sent by her fiancé.</p>

<p>Suddenly two servant girls rushed into the room
exclaiming: "Sidi Mohammed is coming! Here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>is Sidi Mohammed!" The grandfather, the head of
the family, was at the door, and great would be his
wrath should he see his granddaughter learning
music, and above all from a <i>man</i>. Fortunately the
old gentleman, being somewhat infirm, could not
quickly descend from his carriage although assisted
by his two men-servants, so that by the time he made
his appearance the music master was simply hidden
away in a tiny inner room and the whole family
assembled in the courtyard; ready with profuse salutations,
welcomes, and kissing of hands, to conduct
him to one of the principal apartments, <i>not</i>
that in which the Jew was imprisoned. I have often
wondered how long the visit lasted, and whether
the musician was as fortunate as myself in being
soon able to beat a retreat.</p>

<p>Yes! the people are ripe for education&mdash;but is
there not a serious danger in giving them education
and education <i>only</i>? Is it not to be feared that with
minds enlightened to see the errors of Mohammedanism,
they will cast off its bonds only to become
entangled in the meshes of atheism and become a
nation of "libre-penseurs," so that having escaped
the rocks of Scylla they find themselves engulfed in
the whirlpool of Charybdis?</p>

<p>My second illustration represents a poor Arab
woman entering a saint's tomb, over the portal of
which is written: "He (God) opens the doors.
Open to us (O Lord) the best door!" And with my
Christian readers I would plead that they would do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>all in their power both by prayer and by effort, that
while the doors of education and progress are being
thrown wide to these Moslems, the best door&mdash;the
door of the Gospel&mdash;may be opened also, so that
they too may know the glorious liberty wherewith
Christ hath made <i>us</i> free.</p>

<h2>"NOT DEAD, ONLY DRY"</h2>


<p>"It is useless to plant anything: the earth is dead."</p>

<p>"No, it is not dead, it is only dry."</p>

<p>"But I tell you, it is dead. In summer the earth
is always dead: see here." And the Arab who spoke
stooped and picked up a rock-like clod, that he had
hewn with his pickaxe from the trench at his feet.
It looked dead enough certainly; the Algerian soil
in August is much the same in texture as a well-trodden
highway. But it is only waiting.</p>

<p>"It is the very same earth that it is in winter," I
replied; "all it wants is water, and water you must
give it."</p>

<p>With an Oriental's laconic patience, though all
unconvinced, the man went on with the digging of
his trench, and the planting therein of acacia clippings
to make a new thorn hedge where it had been
broken down.</p>

<p>And with a new hope in God my own words came
back to me as I turned away. "It is not dead: it
is only dry."</p>

<p>For of all the soils in the world our Moslem soil
in Algiers seems the most barren, while friend and
foe repeat the same words: "It is useless to plant
anything: the earth is dead."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>
<p>But in the face of both&mdash;in the face of the hosts
of darkness who take up the words and fling them at
us with a stinging taunt&mdash;we affirm in faith:</p>

<p>"No, it is not dead. It is only dry."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Dry: that we know sorrowfully well; it cannot be
otherwise. It is dry soil because Islam has come
nearer doing "despite to the Spirit of grace" than
any other religion; it is, as has been truly said, the
one anti-Christian faith, the one of openly avowed
enmity to the Cross of Christ, the one that deliberately
tramples under foot the Son of God.</p>

<p>It is dry also because in the religion itself there is
something searing, blighting, as with a subtle breath
of hell. This is true of the lands where it has laid
hold, and true of the hearts,&mdash;it is dry.</p>

<p>Dry soil, <span class="smcap">not</span> dead soil. If you were out here in
Algiers and could see and know the people, you
would say so too. The next best thing is to bring
you some of their faces to look at that you may
judge whether the possibilities have gone out of
them yet or not: women faces and girl faces, for it is
of these that I write. Will you spend five minutes of
your hours to-day in looking&mdash;just looking&mdash;at
them, till they have sunk down into your heart?
<span class="smcap">Are</span> they the faces of a dead people? Do you see
no material for Christ if they had a chance of the
Water of Life? These are real living women, living
to-day, unmet by Him.<br /><br /></p>

<p>To begin with, the first glance will show their in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>telligence.
Get an average ignorant Englishwoman
of the peasant class to repeat a Bible story that she
has never heard before. She will dully remember
one or two salient facts. Go up to a mountain
village here and get a group of women and talk to
them, and choose one of them to repeat to the others
what you have said. You will feel after a sentence
or two that your Arabic was only English put into
Arabic words; hers is sparkling with racy idiom.
More than that, she is making the story <i>live</i> before
her hearers: a touch of local color here&mdash;a quaint
addition there. It is all aglow. And this a woman
who has sat year after year in her one garment of
red woollen drapery, cooking meals and nursing
children, with nothing to stimulate any thoughts beyond
the day's need.</p>

<p>And their powers of feeling: do their faces look
as if these have been crushed out by a life of servitude?
Not a bit of it. No European who has
not lived among them can have any idea of their
intensity: love, hate, grief, reign by turns. Anger
and grief can take such possession of them as to
bring real illness of a strange and undiagnosable
kind. We have known such cases to last for months;
not unfrequently they end fatally; and more than
one whom we have met has gone stone-blind with
crying for a dead husband who probably made
things none too easy while he lived.</p>

<p>And then their will power: the faces tell of that
too. The women have far more backbone than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>their menkind, who have been indulged from babyhood;
their school of suffering has not been in vain.
In the beautiful balance of God's justice, all that
man has taken from them in outward rights has been
more than made up in the qualities of endurance
and sacrifice that stand, fire-tried, in their character.</p>

<p>And down beyond these outward capacities, how
about their spirit-nature? It may be hard to believe
at home, but it is a fact that just as the parched
ground of August is the very same as the fertile
earth of spring, so these souls are the very same
as other souls. God is "the God of the spirits of
all flesh." "He hath made of one blood all the inhabitants
of the earth." For <span class="smcap">impressionableness</span>
on the Divine side, they are as quick as in enlightened
lands: I think, quicker. It is only that as soon
as the impression is made "then cometh the devil"
with an awful force that is only now beginning to be
known in Christian countries, and there is not enough
of the Holy Spirit's power to put him to flight.
There will be when the showers come!</p>

<p>As yet the soil is dry: the womenkind are a host
of locked-up possibilities for good and sadly free
possibilities for evil.</p>

<p>The dark side lies in untrueness born of constant
fear of the consequence of every trifling act, moral
impurity that steeps even the children&mdash;wild jealousy
that will make them pine away and die if a
rival baby comes. Their minds are rife with superstition
and fertile in intrigue.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>
<p>And while all this has full play, unchecked and
unheeded, the latent capacities for serving God and
man are wasting themselves in uselessness, pressed
down by the weight of things. There is something
very pathetic in watching the failing brain-power of
the girls. Until fourteen or fifteen years they are
bright, quick at learning; but then it is like a flower
closing, so far as mental effort goes, and soon there
is the complaint: "I cannot get hold of it, it goes
from me." Once grown up, it is painful to see
the labor with which they learn even the alphabet.
Imagination, perception, poetry remain, and resourcefulness
for good and evil, but apart from
God's grace, solid brain power dies. Probably in
the unexplored question of heredity lies the clue;
for at that age for generations the sorrows and cares
of married life have come and stopped mind development
till the brain has lost its power of expansion
as womanhood comes on. Life is often
over, in more senses than one, before they are
twenty.</p>

<p>The story comes before me of three warm-hearted
maidens who a few years ago belonged to
our girls' class: the eldest came but seldom, for she
was toiling over shirtmaking for the support of her
mother and sister. This sister and a friend made
up the trio.</p>

<p>Their mothers were "adherents"&mdash;we had hoped
at one time <span class="smcap">more</span> than adherents, but compromise
was already winning the day: the daughters had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>open hearts towards the Lord, all of them in a
child-like way.</p>

<p>Where are they now?</p>

<p>They came to marriageable age, and Moslem
etiquette required that they should marry. We
begged the mothers to wait a while and see if some
Christian lads were not forthcoming: but no, fashion
binds as much in a Moslem town as in the West
End of London.</p>

<p>The eldest girl was carried out fainting from her
home to be the wife of a countryman. He was
good to her: his mother became madly jealous.
Within two years the bride fell into a strange kind
of decline; when death came there were symptoms
showing that it was from slow poison.</p>

<p>The second to marry was the little friend. At
her wedding feast those who had forced the marriage
on, drugged her with one of their terrible
brain-poisons. The spell worked till she could not
bear the sight of us, and hated and denounced
Christ.</p>

<p>It wore itself out after a few months and light
and love crept back. We went away for the summer.
Before we returned she had been put to death
by her husband. Through the delirium of the last
day and night her one intelligible cry was "Jesus";
so the broken-hearted mother told us. She was an
only child.</p>

<p>The third is still alive, a mere girl. She has been
divorced twice already from drunken, dissolute hus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>bands.
Long intervals of silent melancholy come
upon her, intense and dumb, like threatening brain-trouble.
She was playful as a kitten five years ago.</p>

<p>Poor little souls&mdash;crushed every one of them at
sixteen or seventeen under the heel of Islam. Do
you wonder that we do not consider it an elevating
creed?</p>

<p>And yet they have gone under without tasting
the bitterest dregs of a native woman's cup; for
(save a baby of the eldest girl's who lived only a
few weeks) there were no children in the question.
And the woman's deepest anguish begins where they
are concerned. For divorce is always hanging over
her head. The birth of a daughter when a son had
been hoped for, an illness that has become a bit tedious,
a bit of caprice or counter-attraction on the
husband's part&mdash;any of these things may mean that
he will "tear the paper" that binds them together,
and for eight francs the kadi will set him free. This
means that the children will be forced from the
mother and knocked about by the next wife that
comes on the scene; and the mother-heart will suffer
a constant martyrdom from her husband if only
divorce can be averted. The Algerian women may
claim the boys till seven and the girls till ten or
twelve; the countrywomen have no claim after the
little life becomes independent of them for existence.</p>

<p>Look at the awful and fierce sadness of this face:
more like a wild creature than a woman.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> She has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>probably been tossed from home to home until she is
left stranded, or wrecked on rocks of unspeakable
sin and shame: for that is how it ends, again and
again.</p>

<p>Turn from her: we cannot have her to be the
last. Look once more at a girl, untroubled as yet.
If you want to see what the women could be if but
the social yoke of Islam were loosed from their
shoulders, study the little maidens upon whom it has
not yet come. Take one of them if you can get hold
of her&mdash;even a stupid one, as this one may be with
all her soft grace&mdash;let her expand for a few weeks
in an atmosphere of love and purity. Watch the
awakening: it is as lovely a thing as you could wish
to see, outside the kingdom of God.</p>

</div>

<p>And if this budding and blossoming can come with
the poor watering of human love, what could it be
with the heavenly showers, in their miracle-power of
drawing out all that there is in the earth that they
visit. Oh the capacities that are there! The soil
is "only dry."</p>

<p>And in the very fact of its utter dryness lies our
claim upon God. "I will make the shower to come
down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing,"
is His promise. The "season" for the showers
in these southern lands, is the time of utmost
drought. It is not in July when the gold lingers in
the grass, but in September when the tangle of the
spring has sunk to ashen gray, ready to crumble
at a touch&mdash;it is then that we know the rains are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>nearing. God's "season" comes when all has gone
down to despair.</p>

<p>So we look round on our Moslem field, and triumph
in the dryness that is so like death, for it
shows that we need not have long to wait.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>But a great fight is fought overhead in the natural
world out here before the rains are set free: the
poor dry lands seem to wrestle against the one
thing that they need. Before the clouds burst there
will come days&mdash;weeks, perhaps, off and on&mdash;of
fierce sirocco, hurling them back as they try to
gather. Sometimes they seem on the point of
breaking, and a few drops may get through the
heavy air, then back go the clouds, leaving the brassy
glare undimmed. On the fight goes, and gets only
harder and harder, till suddenly the victory is won.
The south wind drops, or shifts to the west, and the
clouds, laden now with their treasure, mass themselves
in the east; then the wind wheels to the east
and gets behind them, and in an hour or less, unresisted,
they are overhead; unresisted, the windows of
heaven are opened, and the rain comes down in
floods with a joyful splash, drenching the earth to
its depths, and calling to life every hidden potentiality.</p>

<p>A fight like that lies before us in the lands of
Islam. It has begun even now; for we have seen
again and again the clouds gather and swept back,
leaving a few drops at best, and these often quickly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>dried. They are not yet full of rain, so they do not
empty themselves upon the earth.</p>

<p>And it is not from this side that they can be
stored: it is not the thirsty earth that can fill them.
They travel from afar, where ocean, river, and lake
can breathe their vapors upward, swept unseen by
the wind that bloweth where it listeth, to the parched
places. We need you, in the far-off, Spirit-watered
lands to store the showers. You may be but a roadside
pool, but your prayer-breath may go up to be
gathered in God's clouds and break in His "plentiful
rain." When the clouds are full He will still the
sirocco blast of evil that fights it back, and it will
come down with the sudden swift ease that marks
the setting in of the rains here, year by year.</p>

<p>Do we believe that each heaven-sent prayer brings
the cloud-burst nearer? That one last cry of faith,
somewhere, will set it free? Do we act as if we believed
it? Shall we give ourselves to hasten it?</p>

<p>And when it comes, we shall see the latent possibilities
awake, and the latent powers assert themselves,
and the people of Moslem countries, men and
women, show what they can be and do for Him and
in His kingdom. For, thank God, they are not
dead lands, they are "only dry."<br /><br /></p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII</h2>

<h2>LIGHT IN DARKEST MOROCCO</h2>


<p>The factors in a Moorish woman's life are
largely those of her Moslem sisters everywhere;
excepting as exaggerated by the absence of all English
or French influence. In Morocco we have the
rugged path Mohammed allotted their sex painfully
adhered to, and any European influence of
other lands conspicuous by its absence. The lack of
education, inability to read, undeveloped powers of
thought handed through the generations of thirteen
centuries, are at least not lessened by time or weakened
by heredity.</p>

<p>The families in which daughters are allowed to
read are few and far between: just an occasional
one among high-class government officials, or a
favorite daughter here and there who is destined
to support herself and relatives by teaching the few
privileged to learn among the rising generation.
The little girl is seldom welcomed at birth. It is a
calamity she was not a boy. A few years of half-freedom
for the town-child and hasty neglect for
the village maiden. Many a better-class woman
enters her home as a bride, in the carriage which so
carefully conceals her, and sees but four white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>washed
walls for the remainder of her days, nor
leaves their monotony until carried out in her coffin.
What uplifting or educating influences does the
bare windowless abode (opening only to the central
court of the home) exercise? We hear betimes of
the wish to remove the veil and allow more liberty
to woman. In Morocco she is hardly ready for the
change, but needs educating and preparing, ere,
with propriety and true modesty, she can take her
rightful place.</p>

<p>Divorce is fearfully common and easy. Plurality
of wives is an awful curse. The chief features of
home-life are quarrels, intrigues, attempted poisonings,
and rankling bitternesses.</p>

<p>Slavery is more common than in other countries
so near the borders of civilization, and the possession
of these human chattels denotes the measure of
worldly prosperity. Occasionally they find a kindly
master, but, more often, are inhumanly treated and
regarded as so much property. We are frequently
urged to treat the slave for illness and so increase
her market value, while the wife, or wives, may
suffer unnoticed and unassisted.</p>

<p>The Moorish woman has little part in religious
life. She has no merits or opportunity of attaining
such, unless she be a well-known lineal descendant
of their prophet. Very few learn the prescribed
form of Moslem prayers and fewer still use them.
Once and again we find one going through the
positions of prayer and accompanying set phrases.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>These women are usually the most difficult to deal
with and least ready for the hearing of the Gospel.
One of them, during a medical visit, drew her prayer
mat to a distance lest I defile it and closed her ears
with her fingers to shut out my words. Undoubtedly
the <i>very best</i>, and often <i>only</i>, way of reaching
them is through the dispensary.</p>

<p>Their lives centre largely round the three annual
feasts, in preparation for and enjoyment of them.
Every birth, circumcision, wedding, death, and even
serious illness, is an opportunity, for those allowed
sufficient freedom, to receive and pay visits, feast,
enjoy the accompanying minstrels, appear in their
most gorgeous dress and criticise that of others.
Meanwhile they engage in empty and profitless conversation,
which too often passes into the injurious
both for body and soul, of young and old, hostess
and guests. Much attention is paid to fashion, and
Moorish etiquette is not to be lightly treated or
easily fulfilled.</p>

<p>Some of the women figure in the weird orgies of
religious sects of a private and public character.
Their wild, dishevelled, and torn hair is prominent
in the Satanic dance of the Aisowia Derwishes, and
they vie with the men in its frenzied freaks, falling
finally exhausted to the ground, unable to rise. But
this class fortunately is not numerous. I was visiting
in one of these houses last year in Fez. The
occupants were strangers and had come pleading
me to relieve one in very acute pain. The atmos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>phere
of the room hung heavily over me, I knew not
why. Taking my colloquial Gospel, I spoke of
Christ and asked to read. A blank refusal was the
answer. Then the storm broke and during my second
visit I had to rise and leave, asserting my union
with Christ and the impossibility of having me or
my drugs without the message of my Master and
Saviour. They have since been, when the violent
pain returned, pleading for relief, but not again
inviting to their house. Such uncanny sense of the
immediate presence of the evil one, I have never experienced,
as when under their roof, nor would wish
to again. It was an intense relief to breathe freely
in the open air afterwards. Yet two of our recent
converts, and one of them among the most promising,
have belonged to these followers of Satan!
Their wild hair is now neatly braided and they are
clothed and in their right minds, sitting with their
converted sisters to learn more of Jesus and lifting
up voices in prayer to Him.</p>

<p>Female slaves, from the far Soudan, are betimes
among our bitterest and loudest opponents during
Gospel teaching. They have more courage than
their mistresses and are more outspoken. Yet, even
among them, we have seen notable changes. One,
exceptionally well-taught and able to quote the
Koran, met me first with loud contradiction in her
Fez home. Frequent attendance at our medical
mission wrought a marvellous change. Open opposition
first ceased. Then an awakening, and at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>least intellectual, acceptance of the vital truths of
Christianity and readiness to explain them to newcomers.
When she had to follow her master to the
south, we were conscious of losing a friend and
helper. She took with her a Gospel and was followed
by our prayers.</p>

<p>Classes for sewing, reading, and singing are important
factors as means of reaching the women and
girls. The first of my four years at the Tulloch
Memorial Hospital, Tangier, brought me in contact
with a most interesting woman. Many years she
had been under Mrs. Mensink's teaching and otherwise
had known the missionaries. A gradual awakening
was manifest, until, during that year, when
ill with pneumonia, I found her apparently trusting
Jesus. One difficulty haunted her, she was ignorant,
could not even read, and her teachers told her
Jesus was not the Son of God;&mdash;must they not know
best? A few days before her death she joyously
told me of a dream she had had and assured me her
last doubt had gone. In it Jesus appeared to her
and proclaimed Himself the Son of God. No after-cloud
damped her joy. The death-bed was that of a
consistent Christian. Her relatives would not own
it and buried her as a Moslem in their own cemetery,
with her face towards Mecca.</p>

<p>This year, in one of our inland cities, not a few
members of sewing classes have simply trusted
Christ for salvation and now meet for prayer and
instruction with their leaders. A native women's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>prayer meeting has been formed, where each of
these new converts takes part and learns to pray.
Several also have been led to Jesus through the
medical mission and the visitation of their homes.</p>

<p>An instance of earnest simplicity in prayer occurred
in our own home. We had spoken to a convert
about prayer. She said, "I am too old to learn
and too ignorant!" The following day when asked,
she replied: "Oh, yes, I prayed this morning."
"And what did you say?" "Well, I did not know
at first, but then repeated the only prayer I knew,
the first chapter of the Koran, and at the end added,
'in the name and for the sake of the Lord Jesus,'
and I thought <i>He</i> would understand it and fill in for
me all I had been mistaken in or unable to tell Him."
He truly did so, for since that time the dear old
woman has learned to pray. Grasping my hand
after one native prayer meeting, she said, "Oh, to
think of it! three of us praying together in the name
of Jesus; three of us believing in Him." These
were, her married daughter, an only son, and herself.
One of these converts of last spring had
typhus fever a few months later and passed into the
Presence of Him whom she had learned to love.
Another is nearing her end and wonders why He
tarries so long in coming to take her to be with
Himself.</p>

<p>One day's journey from Tangier on mule-back,
lives the first woman I ever heard pray; consistently
she seeks to tell others the little she knows. A lady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>missionary, since departed, lived with her a fortnight
in the early days of the North African Mission.
She dates her conversion from that time and,
without any resident missionary since, dependent
only upon the teaching of a few days or weeks during
an itinerating visit, she still knows and can explain
to others that "the blood of Jesus Christ
cleanseth from all sin." Nearly all of this year's
numerous converts are the result of much seed-sowing
and the patient labors of long years past, now
gathered by prayer into the fold. Not a few of the
sowers have passed to their reward without seeing
the harvest which should be.</p>

<p>We have found medical work a powerful handmaid
to awaken interest in the Gospel story. To
our great grief, however, the continued political unrest,
due largely to the presence of the Pretender
and rising of the tribes from time to time, during
the past four years, has almost closed up this highly
useful evangelistic and Christ-like work.</p>

<p>The Northern rebellion would have ceased long
ago had the present Sultan honest and energetic
soldiers and leaders. Few, however, are impervious
to foreign gold; and no one trusts another, unless
he pay well for the interest in his affairs. The
Sultan is a pleasant and enlightened person, but
unable to cope with the surrounding lawlessness
single-handed. Many a tale of bribery and wrong
reaches us. The wild tribes know no other fear
than that of seeing turbulent skulls and rebellious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>heads hanging upon the city gates. We went down
to Fez four years ago, a few weeks after the violent
and sad death of our dear friend and brother, Mr.
Cooper. His only crime in the eyes of the violent
tribesman, his murderer, was that of being a foreigner.
Two weeks after our arrival in the city,
Consuls ordered foreigners to the coast. We had
to obey. Six weeks were spent in Tangier and then
again we returned to our scene of labor, the large
out-patient dispensary which treated over eleven
thousand cases last year and so reached between
two hundred and one hundred and fifty with the
Gospel on Women's mornings, every day.</p>

<p>Two years ago orders again came to pack up and
prepare for emergencies. The storm blew over and
since then the main roads have been practically safe
for ordinary traffic and merchandise. Even the foreigner
can securely take his place in any caravan
without fear of ill.</p>

<p>Raisuli's capture of European and American citizens
for hostages alarmed many, but he had sought
the Government's recognition of his lawful Kaidship,
and when refused, wrongly determined to
claim the same by force. The strong hand with
which he now controls those wild tribes under his
jurisdiction, proves his ability to govern. His justice,
if semi-barbarous, is certainly ahead of that of
most of his fellow Kaids. He reversed the decision
of a Moorish tribunal which had wrung from a poor
widow her lawful property, restoring that which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>had been unlawfully taken. A few such men in the
highest circles would soon bring order out of chaos
and strength to the throne. The English missionary
has had the great advantage of being favorably
received by the people on account of his or
her nationality. It stood, to them, for integrity,
strength, and honor. Whatever changes may have
taken place during the last four years to lessen this
trust in her, England has still much favor with the
majority. Hers were the pioneer-missionaries, for
where no man would have been trusted or allowed
to reside, her lady workers penetrated. Before any
resident Consul, Miss Herdman and her companions
went to Fez and commenced medical work. She
won her way into the hearts of the people and is
still lovingly remembered. It was her work which
Mr. Cooper had taken up for a few short years,
when so suddenly snatched from it by a lawless
fanatic's hand. The seed sown thus long and faithfully
has lain dormant. Just a few, one here and
there, gathered into the fold; native converts prepared
for colportage work; the building of a foundation
on the Rock Christ Jesus. But to those who
followed her has been granted to see the increase,
and begin to reckon, even, on the "hundredfold."</p>

<p>The coast towns have ever been more accessible
to the foreigners; yet alas, where the foreigner is
<span class="smcap">least</span> known the native is most receptive, courteous,
and hospitable. The average colonist, or even
tourist, seldom recommends the Kingdom of God,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>and the native points to the drink traffic, so opposed
to his religious views, and asks how that is included
in the Christian country's commerce and consumption!</p>

<p>Thus, the farther removed from <i>such</i> Christian
influence the greater the freedom for Gospel work.
Tangier was first opened; Hope House being a
partial gift to the North African Mission.</p>

<p>At first both men and women were treated here,
but the great desirability of conforming to Moorish
rules of life led to the opening of a Women's Hospital
in the town. Here I did one year's out-patient
work during the absence of the efficient and indefatigable
lady doctor&mdash;Miss Breeze&mdash;in England.
These were largely the ploughing, seed-sowing
days. Since then several have professed conversion.
One, on returning to her village home, was bitterly
persecuted and finally, to escape death, had to flee
by night to her former teachers and with them find
refuge. Some four or five of the elder girls in the
Moorish orphanage came out boldly on the Lord's
side. The teaching of girls has been a prominent
feature of the work in that city.</p>

<p>Larache, two days down the coast by mule, was
permanently opened many years later, some medical
and class work being done, with house to house
visitation. Mr. and Mrs. Taylor, our Scotch
friends, are independent workers here.</p>

<p>El Kaar, six hours inland from Larache and two
days from Tangier by mule, is worked from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>former by the North Africa Mission, and five
American lady workers of the Gospel Union Mission
do good house to house service in that little
town. Its inhabitants are unusually genial and receptive;
these are days of seed-sowing, for the harvest
is not yet. Women's and girls' classes are also
held, and prayers are asked for a few already deeply
interested. Some very happy days have I spent
working among Moorish friends there.</p>

<p>House to house visitation is essentially for the
women. They are always "at home," and to them
we definitely go since they can so seldom come to us.
Classes have already been a prominent feature of the
work in Fez, and gather larger numbers than is
usual in the other towns. This city of some one
hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants has been the
residence of the Sultan and his court for the past
four years. It is consequently very full and affords
splendid opportunities, having been so freely opened
up by the large medical mission established there.</p>

<p>Early in the year, a mother and her daughter said
to me, "We have been loved into <span class="smcap">Heaven</span>, we have
seen the love of Jesus in care and healing during our
sickness, we take Him now as Savior for our souls."
These are living consistently for Him now. Two
years ago a prominent theological professor asked
me in the street for medicine. I directed him to the
medical mission. To the surprise of all he came
often, listened quietly from the first, and, ere long,
became a decided Christian. His wife, a noble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>woman (<i>sherifa</i>), is now reading the Gospel with
him, saying, "Yes, I believe that which is written,
but, oh! I do want to remain a <i>sherifa</i>!" Not yet
can she count all things but loss for the excellency of
the knowledge of Christ Jesus, her Lord.</p>

<p>In an inland town in Morocco, where a number of
women had professed faith in Christ, the question of
baptism arose; two were wishing for it. How could
they brave its publicity? One woman had been
baptized privately in Tangier, few, even of the missionaries,
knew beforehand it was to take place&mdash;so
bitterly were her relatives opposed to the Gospel.
The rite had not been publicly received by any
Moorish woman heretofore. After some eighteen
months of constant teaching in preparation, these
two sisters were ready to brave all danger and opposition,
and despite all efforts to foil their purpose,
passed through the waters of baptism unveiled before
the assembled native church and foreign
missionaries, and that as bravely and modestly as
any Englishwoman would have done. This was a
terrible blow to the devil. He had fought courageously
to avert the calamity to his kingdom, but God
heard continued and earnest prayer that a first public
stand be thus taken for Him. The blow has
fallen upon the powers of darkness and this great
triumph in women's work been gained for Him.
They now "break the bread and drink the wine"
with their converted husbands and friends "until
He come." One of them received such a spiritual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>impetus after the step as to make us fearful lest her
boldness endanger life. She brought a formerly
bigoted relative and said, "Teach her, pray with her,
she is near the Kingdom!" And so it proved, for
that day she "entered in." When reading the colloquial
Gospel of Luke in one of the highest Government
houses, the remark was made to me, "Why,
this is the book and this the story we heard from
Miss McArthur in Morocco city!"</p>

<p>Some of our native colporteurs work with our
Scotch brethren and thus is Christian unity cemented.
Dr. Kerr and his fellow-workers have a
strong medical mission in Rakat and a similar one
was carried on by the North African Mission in
Casablanca, until the recent death of Dr. Grieve.</p>

<p>Tetuan has long maintained its vigorous out-patient
dispensary, successful visiting in the homes,
and numerous classes. Mention should certainly be
made of the great impetus given to labors among
Moorish women by the publication of a Moroccan
colloquial version of Luke. With so few female
readers, and the majority of men even, insufficiently
educated to understand the magnificent classical
translation into Arabic, one within the grasp of
every man, woman, and child was urgently needed.</p>

<p>Our American brethren have hitherto published
only the Gospel of Luke, which has been so well
received, but they hope soon to have in print other
portions, which are eagerly looked for.</p>

<p>You say, "We have heard only of encouraging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>cases, bright prospects, and ingathering; we thought
it was not so in Moslem lands and especially among
their women." Perhaps it has not been, and even
now, only the beginning of early harvest is in the
reaping. Thank God, a grand wheat-garnering
has yet to follow, and those who have labored longest
and seen least fruit will yet divide the spoil.
Undoubtedly there are rejecters of the Cross of
Christ, and His bitterest enemies are surely under
the Crescent's sway. At the same time there is tremendous
encouragement for hearts and laborers
who can "afford to wait" and have learned to pray.</p>

<p>Only twice in our vast crowded city (though
making from six to eight hundred visits in the
homes yearly) have I been refused liberty to speak
for Jesus and <span class="smcap">never</span> been denied admittance. There
are six sisters in Fez doing this work from house
to house, but <span class="smcap">hundreds</span> of homes await us which
we are utterly unable to enter. <span class="smcap">One</span> life is so short
where the need is so great, and open doors are on
every hand. Most of our fellow missionaries in
other stations would plead in the same words.
Doors, doors, but how can we enter them? At
present the people inland are hardly prepared for
the qualified lady doctor. In the bulk of instances
where her skill is most urgently needed, she would
be refused. Miss Breeze, in Tangier, has patiently
labored and trained the women to trust her and submit
to the necessary operations.</p>

<p>Away from the coast a similar patience and train<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>ing
are necessary to prepare the female sex for her
valuable assistance. At present the trained nurse has
the fullest scope, and the limits of her powers represent
the willingness of the people for medical work.
Sad, indeed, are those instances wherein a little assistance
would undoubtedly save life, but is refused
point-blank on the plea "if the patient subsequently
died the missionary would be accused of murder."
At present, no explanation, no persuasion, can
change the fiat. Moorish law, like that of the
Medes and Persians, "altereth not." They are,
however, very susceptible to the influence of drugs,
and the simplest remedies often work cures which
by them are regarded as miracles, and faith in the
"Tabeeba" is proportionately increased.</p>

<p>Colloquial hymns are much valued and a standard
hymn-book would be a great boon. I have taken a
small American organ with me and sung and explained
the Gospel in bigoted and wealthy homes,
where reading it would not have been possible. In
two instances, I took a magic-lantern with me, from
the slides of which plain teaching was an easy task.
Once it was a wedding festival and friends had gathered
to the feast. Our hostess had lived some years
in England with her merchant husband, but a knowledge
of English life, or even ability to speak its
language, by no means predisposes to the reception
of the Truth. It certainly was not so in the present
instance. A few months ago she said to a
fellow missionary, "I know the right is with you.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>I well know what I ought to do&mdash;-leave Mohammed
and accept Jesus&mdash;but this would mean leaving my
husband and children&mdash;turned out of home and
robbed of all! I cannot do it." One sad instance
stands for many: a rejected Gospel!</p>

<p>I once attended a wealthy and influential <i>sherifa</i>
dying of tuberculosis. No English consumptive
clings to life more tenaciously than she did. Everything
was at my disposal and courtesy lavished until
she found there was no hope for her life. Then she
bitterly turned from any word of a Life to come and
flung herself hopelessly upon her charm-writers and
native crudities until past speaking. Her husband
took a Gospel, and I heard, sat up into the night and
studied its contents. We followed the volume with
prayer. To-day news reaches me from the field
that he has died of typhoid fever. Oh! to know he
accepted its truths!</p>

<p>Sometimes those cases where I have given longest
and most frequent medical attention, have finally
been least responsive to the story of the Cross. In
other instances a single visit awakens interest and
the soul goes on into full light and liberty. Several
homes I have closely visited and watched, hoping to
find an entrance for Christ; but not until some serious
illness or other calamity comes are its occupants
sufficiently friendly to hear of God's love in Christ.
The lady worker and constant visitor in her long
white native garment (silham), with veiled face
is much safer, humanly speaking, and usually more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>acceptable than the foreign worker in European
dress. I have even been asked to climb over the
roofs into a house within some sacred precincts,
where infidel foot may not be known to tread, and
one patient was always reached through the stable
door, as the main entrance was too near a so-called
saint's place. Again I was asked to see and treat a
poor sufferer, very ill, in the open street, to avoid
standing on their holy ground and defiling the spot.</p>

<p>Probably all I have written is equally true of any
Moslem land. The religion of Islam knows no
progress and has within itself only the elements of
decay. Means for the propagation of the Gospel
will scarcely vary. The harem always depends
upon the consecrated and tactful sister to reach its
inmates from without. These thousands of homes
can only be entered by the multiplication of the individual
worker a hundredfold.</p>

<p>Now is Morocco's day. A few days later and her
opportunity will have passed by forever. Once
broken up, or Europeanized in any way, and civilized
nations will, perhaps, "fear the propaganda of
the Cross and the distribution of the Bible lest
fanatics be aroused, holy war proclaimed and bloodshed
ensue." At least thus they said when Khartoum
was opened to the merchant, and similarly have
thought other nations in their respective colonies.
They have not yet learned that the converted Moslem
is the only one who can be trusted, and the men
will largely be influenced by what their mothers and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>wives are in the home. They know not as we do,
that, in time of war, unrest, and danger, valuables
and money are brought to the missionary for keeping,
and the place of safety to the native mind is
the mission house. To meet, in any degree, existing
needs, or use present opportunities for freely
distributing and reading the Gospel, teaching its
precepts and hastening Christ's Kingdom in "Sun-set
land," we must strongly re-enforce every station.
Increase the number of missionaries working under
each mission. Send forth women who have learned
how to pray in the home lands to seek these poor
sheep and gather them into the one fold and unto
the one Shepherd. The commencement of this
year's unprecedented blessing among women dates
back primarily and supremely to the increased spirit
of prayer. At first even all the foreign workers
were hardly alive to this, but persistent prayer won
them one by one. Then followed the united requests
for individual souls, and these too were
granted. The Holy Spirit brought us in contact
with those hearts within which He was already
working, or preparing to work, and as a result the
Father was glorified in the Son&mdash;souls were saved,
and not alone among the angels, but even upon earth
and amid the Church militant.</p>

<p>These babes in Christ need daily tending and
teaching as little children. The work in the hands
of those workers already in the field can scarcely
allow any addition, and yet we <span class="smcap">prayed</span> for these; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>now who shall feed them? Not only so, some are
still halting between two opinions, reading the
Word and needing the loving hand to lead them
gently over the line; but this individual care is a
big task where women's medical mornings each
already bring one hundred and twenty to one hundred
and fifty patients. Surely we shall unite in
the prayer to the Lord of the Harvest, that He send
forth laborers into His harvest and to some&mdash;as we
pray&mdash;He will answer, "Go ye!"</p>

<h2>MOHAMMEDAN WOMEN IN THE CENTRAL SOUDAN</h2>


<p>The form of Islam seen in the large centres of
population in the Hausa States is that of a virile,
aggressive force, in no sense effete or corrupted by
the surrounding paganism. It has had no rival systems
such as Hinduism or Buddhism to compete
with, and until now has not come into conflict with
Christianity. The distinctive characteristics of the
African have, however, tended to increase in it sensualism
and a laxity of morals, and this has stamped,
to a large extent, the attitude <i>toward</i> women and the
character <i>of</i> women as developed under its system.</p>

<p>Social and moral evils, which may have a thin
cloak thrown over them in the East as well as in
those lands of Islam in the North of Africa, are
open, and boldly uncovered, in the Hausa States.</p>

<p>Most of what is written in this chapter refers to
the Hausa women, who form by far the greatest
number in this country; but it is necessary to write
a few lines first about the Fulani women, who are
aliens and of a different social, political, and racial
type.</p>

<p>It is now generally acknowledged that these people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>&mdash;Fulanis&mdash;originally
came from Asia, or at least
are Semitic.</p>

<p>They are the rulers of all this great empire, and
have for a hundred years exercised a tyrannical rule
over the Hausas and the pagan peoples whom they
had succeeded in enslaving before British rule in
turn overcame them. The Fulani women are many
of them olive-colored; some are beautiful and all
have the small features, thin lips, straight nose, and
long straight hair associated with the Asiatic. The
Fulani rulers, following the Eastern fashion, have
large harems and keep their women very secluded.</p>

<p>The late Emir of Zaria was terribly severe to all
his people, and cruel to a degree with any of his
wives who transgressed in any way or were suspected
of unfaithfulness. In one instance in which
a female slave had assisted one of his wives to
escape, both being detected, the wife was immediately
decapitated and the slave given the head in an
open calabash and ordered by the Emir to fan the
flies off it until next night!</p>

<p>I have been admitted into the home of one such
family, the home of one of the highest born of all
the Fulani chiefs, saw two of the wives and bowed
to them, but the two little girls of seven and eight
years came to call on me. On the whole I was struck
with the cheerful appearance of the wife and the
sweetness of the two little girls, but the husband
was a particularly nice man, I should <i>think</i> a kind
husband, and I <i>know</i> a kind father.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>
<p>I knew one other Fulani lady long after the death
of her husband, she being about sixty-five years of
age, and a very nice woman in many ways. She
told me that her husband, although of good family,
had married only her and that they had been happily
married for over thirty years when he died, and she
had remained a widow. I fear, however, these are
exceptional cases and that the ordinary life of the
women of the ruling Fulani class is a hard one.</p>

<p>I was once sitting in my compound when a well-covered
and veiled woman came to see me, with the
excuse that she wanted medicine. After some conversation
I found it was trouble that had brought
her. She had been for some years loved by her husband
but had had no children; so her husband had
married another wife and disliked her now, and she
wanted medicine from me to make him love her
again! She begged me never to mention that she
had come to me, saying that her husband would certainly
beat her nearly to death if he knew that she
had come out, and much more so if he knew she had
come to me.</p>

<p>The ease with which all Hausa women, but
specially those of the middle and lower classes, can
obtain divorce for almost any reason; also the frequency
with which they can obtain redress for
cruelty from their husbands in the native courts,
gives them power and a position in the community
not to be despised. A man, for instance, in order
to get a girl of sixteen years in marriage will pay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>her parents a sum of perhaps ten or twelve pounds.
If at any future time she desires to leave him and
marry another man, she can do so by swearing before
the native courts that they have quarrelled and
that she no longer wishes to live with him. But if
that is all she merely gets a paper of divorce and
either herself or her next husband has to refund to
the aggrieved former husband the sum originally
paid for her. If, however, she can prove violence
or injury from her husband she has not to pay him
anything, but may even in some cases get damages.</p>

<p>A girl is usually given the option of refusing the
man whom her parents have arranged for her to
marry. This is not often done, but I have known of
some cases in which the girl has availed herself of
the privilege, and stated that she prefers some one
else, in which case the engagement is broken and the
new marriage arranged at once with the man of her
choice.</p>

<p>In the villages, and among the lower classes in the
cities, girls are not usually married until they are
about sixteen. Frequently, however, among the
higher and wealthier classes the engagement is made
by the parents when she is much younger, perhaps
eleven or twelve, and she is after that confined with
some strictness to the house or else carefully
watched.</p>

<p>There is a very vicious and terribly degrading
habit amongst the Hausas, which is known as
"Tsaranchi." One cannot give in a word an Eng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>lish
equivalent and one does not desire to describe
its meaning. It has the effect of demoralizing most
of the young girls and making it almost certain
that very few girls of even eleven or twelve have
retained any feelings of decency and virtue.</p>

<p>In this the girls are deliberately the tempters, and
many boys and young men are led into sin who
would not have sought it. Here one must not blame
the women or the girls, for the original sin is with
the men, who, through the terribly degrading system
of polygamy and slave concubinage, have introduced
since centuries that which destroys the purity
of the home, and makes it impossible for the children
to grow up clean-minded. It is a sad fact that the
evil effect of this seems to have acted more on the
women and children than on the men.</p>

<p>One feels sorely for the boys brought up in this
land without a glimpse of purity in true home life;
with never a notion of a woman being the most holy
and chaste and beautiful of all God's creation, and
never seeing even the beauty of girlhood purity.</p>

<p>One is glad to see that among many of the men
there is a growing feeling that they have lost much
in this way; and often in talking to men on the
subject of women and their naturally depraved condition,
I have shown them how, where women are
given the place God meant them to have in the home
and in the social and religious life of a people, their
character is always the most regenerating thing in
the life of a nation, and that it is useless for them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>to wish their women to be different when they do
everything to prevent the possibility. With the boys
in my own compound and under my own care I am
bound to forbid all intercourse with girls because of
their evil minds and influence. Of course such a
thing is fearfully unnatural and cuts off from a
boy's life all those influences which we in Christian
lands consider so much tend to strengthen and
deepen and soften his character.</p>

<p>It is easy to see from the above the reason why
amongst those who are careful to preserve a semblance
of chastity, the girls are carefully secluded
from a tender age and not allowed outside their
compounds except under exceptional circumstances,
until the time that they are about to be taken to
the house of the man to whom they have been betrothed.</p>

<p>This preservation of virtue by force, points to the
fact that there is no public opinion; no love of purity
for its own sake; no real and vital principle in Islam
which tends to preserve and build up purity.</p>

<p>A mere lad, the viciousness of whose first wife
had led him quickly to take a second, said to me
when protested with for doing it, "Our women are
not like yours, and you can never tell what it all
means to us. Even if we wanted to be good they
would hinder us."</p>

<p>The existence of a large class of pagan slave girls,
who have been caught and brought from their own
homes and carried into the Hausa country to become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>members of the harem of some of the Hausas, also
complicates and intensifies the evil; for this mixture
only tends to lower the standards and make the
facilities for sin tenfold easier.</p>

<p>It is not true in the Central Soudan, as is so often
stated, that polygamy tends to diminish the greater
evils of common adultery and prostitution. These
are very frequent, and it is perfectly true what man
after man has sadly told me, that no one trusts even
his own brother in the case of married relationships.
I am bound to acknowledge, however, in honesty,
that these evils are intensified in the cantonments
with their large number of native soldiers of loose
character, and some even of one's own immoral
countrymen.</p>

<p>I have seen very little systematic cruelty towards
women or children, except of course in the slave-raiding
and slave markets which are now happily
abolished. Women are able to take care of themselves
and certainly do, so far as I have seen.</p>

<p>The knowledge that a wife may leave at will, that
less labor can be got out of a cruelly-treated slave
wife, and that little girls can leave home and find a
place elsewhere, all have tended to make women's
lives freer, and to some extent less hard in the
Central Soudan than in North Africa.</p>

<p>On the other hand, one is struck with the apparent
lack of love, and forced to the conclusion that a
woman is not in any sense, to a man of the Hausa
race, more than a necessary convenience; a woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>to look after his house, have children, and prepare
his meals. In old age she is often abandoned or
driven away, or becomes a mere drudge. This is
often the case also with a man, if not wealthy; when
old his wives will leave him, and many a case I have
seen of such desolation. Of real love which triumphs
over circumstances of poverty and sickness there is
but little; women will leave their husbands when
through misfortune they have lost their wealth,
and go and marry another, returning later when
fortune has again favored the original husband and
frowned on the later one.</p>

<p>I met one beautiful exception to this. One of the
most beautiful girls I have seen in the Hausa states,
with a really good face and one which anywhere
would have been pronounced pretty, brought her
blind husband to me. When married he had been
really good to her, and after one year had lost his
sight. For four years she had stuck to him and
tended him and really loved him, taking him from
one native doctor to another, and at last to me. It
was touching to see her gentleness to him and the
evident trust of each in the other. I have never seen
such another in the Hausa country. Yet what possibilities
of the future!</p>

<p>Very few girls attain the most elementary standard
of education. But some few <i>do</i> and every
facility is provided for those who can and will go
farther, and I have known girls, mostly those whose
fathers were <i>mallams</i>, who learned to read and write
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>the Koran well, and who were considered quite proficient;
and at least one case I know of a woman
who, because of her wisdom and education, was entrusted
with the rule of two or three cities in her
father's Emirate.</p>

<p>The chief occupations of women are the grinding
of corn and the preparation of food for the family,
the care of their babies, who are slung on their backs,
the carrying of water from the well or brook, and,
to some extent in the villages, agriculture, though
with the exception of the poor slaves it is rare to see
women overworked in the fields.</p>

<p>They are great traders also, and if not young or
too attractive looking, they are allowed to take their
flour, their sweetmeats, etc., to the markets and
trade. Then again when the season for all agricultural
work is at an end, and their husbands and
brothers start for the west and the coast places, for
the long wearisome journey which takes them to the
places where they sell their rubber, nitre, and other
goods, and bring back salt, woollen and cotton goods,
the women go with them, and it is a most pretty
and interesting sight to see the long row of these
young women, in single file, neatly and modestly
dressed, with white overalls and a load of calabashes
and cooking utensils neatly packed and carried on
their heads. They often sing as they march, and
coming in at the end of the day's journey, light the
fires and prepare the meal for themselves and their
male relatives, while the latter go and gather the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>sticks and grass to make a temporary shelter for the
night.<br /><br /></p>

</div>

<p><br />They are tidy, industrious, and lively, and, to any
one who did not understand their language, these
women would give the impression of a charming
picture and of many things good and true. But to
one who could hear the conversation, as I often have,
the secret of the utter depravity of all the people is
soon learned, and one sees how it is that none grow
up with any idea of purity. The minds of even
young children are vitiated from the earliest age.</p>

<p>I have found many very "religious" women. It
must, however, not be forgotten that the religion of
Islam is totally divorced from the practice of all
morals. Women in some numbers attend the weekly
midday service in the mosques, sitting apart and
worshipping.</p>

<p>One very handsome woman whom I knew had as
a little child been enslaved, and later married to the
Emir of Zaria, and had been the mother or stepmother
of many of the Zaria princes. She was a
very religious woman, was allowed a fair amount of
liberty, and was much respected. She not infrequently
attended the services and was much interested.
But it is certain that, with the exception of
the use of a certain number of pious expressions,
religion has little hold over the Hausa women, and
they can in no sense be considered to share in the
devotions of the men, or to be companions with the
men in those things which are the deepest part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>human nature. Hence with Christians there is the
learning of a new relationship altogether, when the
man begins to feel that his wife must be his companion
and helpmeet in things pertaining to all his
life and soul and spirit.</p>

<p>Amongst the very lowest classes, with whom
there are less objections to coming into contact with
men, and especially white men, and who in their
suffering have allowed us to minister to them, I have
been able to get a glimpse into the terrible sufferings
of the poor women of all the other classes. In
their hours of agony and suffering they can get no
alleviation, no nursing or skill to shorten the hours
of weary pain, and in large numbers they die terrible
deaths for the lack of that surgical help we
could so easily render them. I was able once to
visit a woman who seemed to be dying. She was in
a terrible condition; the complete delivery of her
child could not be effected, and for two days she
had been in a shocking state. In their despair her
people asked me to come, and within three hours,
by surgical knowledge, we were able to put her
right, and finally get her to sleep and complete her
cure. But we were told that many, many died in
the condition in which we found her, and that there
was never any thought of calling for help. Many a
man who seemed fairly intelligent, and to whom I
have talked almost with indignation of such things,
has answered me: "We do not know what to do; our
women cannot help these cases, for they have no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>skill, and we would any of us rather let them die than
call a man in to help." And so they do die. They
will not yet trust us, although they fully realize that
we are different from their own religious leaders.
Whole realms of thought have yet to be broken
through, whole tracts of life principles and perverted
ideas have to be destroyed, before it will be
possible for the many poor sufferers in this land to
get what the love of Christ has brought within their
grasp, but which they are afraid as yet to take.</p>

<p>I have tried to show that there is a bright as well
as a sombre side to this picture; that where there is
restraint there is often some kindness; that with
ignorance there is often a desire and a yearning after
better things, and a dull feeling that what <i>is</i>, is <i>not</i>
best.</p>

<p>Nothing but a radical change in the very fundamental
ideas of woman, even by woman herself, can
bring about the regeneration of this land. Only
the restoration of woman to the place gained for
her by Christ, and snatched from her again by the
prophet of Islam, can bring true holiness and life
into the homes of Hausa, and bring a new hope and
reality into the lives of the men.</p>

<p>The knowledge and worship of Christ are beginning
to do this, and in one or two homes in North
Nigeria already men, who previously thought
woman inferior human beings or superior cattle, and
who would have looked upon it as madness to suggest
that a woman should be considered the helpmeet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>of the man in all that pertains to this life Godward
and manward, are restoring to their wives and mothers
and sisters that dignity. How happy will be the
result when this spirit has spread and all the land has
begun to feel the influence of good and holy women
in the home, the market, the school, and the church.</p>

<h2>A STORY FROM EAST AFRICA</h2>


<p>Mombasa, though a Mohammedan town, is perhaps
scarcely a typical one, as of late years it has
become decidedly cosmopolitan, still in what is called
the "Old Town" Mohammedanism with all its attendant
ignorance and bigotry prevails.</p>

<p>There are women in this part of the mission-field
with whom we have talked and prayed in past years,
who seem further off from the Truth and Light
than they were even in those early years of work
amongst them.</p>

<p>These are the words of a young girl who, we
know, was convinced of the truth of the Gospel:
"Oh, Bibi, if I confess Christ openly I shall be
turned out of my home, I shall have neither food
nor clothing, and [with a shudder] perhaps they will
kill me." We knew this was only too true.</p>

<p>She was a beautiful girl with sweet, gentle manners,
living in those days with her sister in a dark,
ill-ventilated room which opened on to a small courtyard
where all the rubbish of the house seemed to
be thrown, and where goats, hens, and miserable-looking
cats seemed thoroughly at home amongst
the refuse.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>
<p>Yet, in spite of these surroundings and in spite
of her knowledge of all manner of evil (alas! how
early these children learn things which we would
think impossible to teach a little child), in spite of
all this she was pure and good. Now she seems to
have no desire at all to hear or read the Gospel.
When we do see her, her manner is always flippant
and worldly. We don't want to give her up, we
keep on praying for her, but there have been so many
hardening influences since those early days, and she
never took the definite step of openly confessing
Christ. She was soon married to a man much older
than herself who already had a wife; probably more
than one. We suppose he was a higher bidder!</p>

<p>She had one little baby that soon pined away and
died. How can women, brought up as she was, have
healthy children? Amongst all the Mohammedan
women I have visited here I have never known
one to have more than two children. The majority
have no living child.</p>

<p>I believe the husband was kind to her, but he did
not live long, and very soon she was married again.
If she bears no children he will probably tire of
her and leave her. I have been told by one of
the women that if a wife does not cook his food
properly he may get a divorce. One old woman I
saw to-day told me that her daughter is now married
to her third husband; the other two left her for some
trivial reason. When I asked, "What will become
of her when she is old and perhaps cast off again?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ah, Bibi!" she said, "what <i>has</i> become of me? I
am weak and ill and old, and yet I have to cook
and work for others." This is just what does happen
unless they have a house and property of their
own. They become household drudges to those relations
who take them in, and there is rejoicing at
their death.</p>

<p>The rule here is for each man to have four wives,
if he can afford it. The number of concubines is, I
believe, unlimited. Here the wives live each in a
separate house. The reason given is: "If we lived
together we should be jealous and quarrel and make
our husband miserable."</p>

<p>I have known cases where the husband has only
the one wife and there seems to be a certain amount
of affection. One little wife said to me the other
day, "I love my husband now, but if he ever takes
another wife I shall hate him and leave him."</p>

<p>Could one blame her?</p>

<p>In most cases just as a girl has learned to read
she has been forbidden by her husband, and I have
been told, "My husband says there is no profit in
women learning to read and he has forbidden it."</p>

<p>How one has felt for and grieved with some of
these women! One day in going as usual to give a
reading lesson to a mother and daughter (these two
really loved each other), I found them both very
sad and miserable. It seemed that the father of the
girl determined to marry her to an elderly man
whom, of course, she had never seen. The mother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>said her daughter was too young to be married, and
she knew something of the character of the man.
She begged me to try and do something, but we were
quite helpless in the matter; a large sum of money
was paid for the daughter. Some time afterwards
when I visited the house the mother said to me,
"Yes, Bibi, she is married to him and I have had to
sit in the room listening to the cries of my child as
he ill-treated her in the next room, but I could do
nothing."</p>

<p>How one longs for the skill to bring home to our
favored English girls and wives and mothers, the
awful wrongs and the needs of these their Moslem
sisters! But what human weakness cannot do, God
by His Holy Spirit can. May He lead some of you
to give yourselves to the glorious work of bringing
light and life to these your sisters who are "Sitting
in darkness and the shadow of death." Love is
what they want. Our love that will bring knowledge
of Christ's great love to them. Will you not
pray for them?</p>

<span class="i13">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Arabic Proverbs</span>.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>This is an outline sketch of the pitiful intellectual,
social, and moral condition of the nearly four million
women and girls in Mohammedan Arabia. To begin
with, the percentage of illiteracy, although not so
great as in some other Moslem lands, is at least
eighty per cent, of the whole number. In Eastern
Arabia a number of girls attend schools, but the instruction
and discipline are very indifferent; attention
to the lesson is not demanded, so that a Moslem
school is a paradise for a lazy girl! A girl is removed
from school very early to prepare for her life-work
and that is marriage. In a majority of cases
she soon forgets what little knowledge she may have
attained. A few women are good readers, but these
are the most bigoted and fanatical of all women, and
it is difficult to make any impression upon them as
they are firmly convinced that the Koran contains
all they need for salvation now and hereafter.</p>

<p>General ignorance is the cause of general unhappi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>ness
and such dense ignorance often makes them suspicious
and unreasonable. Nothing is done by the
men to educate their women. On the contrary, their
object seems to be to keep them from thinking for
themselves. They "treat them like brutes and they
behave as such." The men keep their feet on the
necks of their women and then expect them to rise!
The same men who themselves indulge in the grossest
form of immorality become very angry and cruel
if there is a breath of scandal against their women.
In Bahrein, a young pearl-diver heard a rumor that
his sister was not a pure woman; he returned immediately
from the divings and stabbed her in a most
diabolical way without even inquiring as to the truth
of the matter. She died in great agony from her
injuries, and the brother was acquitted by a Moslem
judge, who is himself capable of breaking all the
commandments.</p>

<p>Polygamy is practised by all who can afford this
so-called luxury, particularly by those in high positions.
The wives of these men are not happy, but
submit since they believe it is the will of God and of
His prophet. The women are not at all content with
their condition, and each one wishes herself to be
the favored one and will take steps to insure this if
possible. Those who have learned a little of the
social condition of women in Christian lands very
readily appreciate the difference.<br /><br /></p>

<p><br />It is a common thing for us to be asked to prescribe
poison for a rival wife who has been added
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>to the household and for the time being is the
favorite. Through jealousy some of these supplanted
wives plunge into a life of sin. I do not
know anything more pathetic than to have to listen
to a poor soul pleading for a love-philter or potion
to bring back the so-called love of a perfidious husband.
Women, whether rich or poor, naturally prefer
to be the only wife. Divorce is fearfully common;
I think perhaps it is the case in nine out of
every ten marriages. Many women have been
divorced several times. They marry again, but this
early and frequent divorce causes much immorality.
Some divorced women return to the house of their
parents, while the homeless ones are most miserable
and find escape from misery only in death.</p>

<p>All these horrible social conditions complicate
matters and it is difficult to find out who is who in
these mixed houses. It is far more pathetic to go
through some Moslem homes than to visit a home
for foundlings. When a woman is divorced, the
father may keep the children if he wishes, and no
matter how much a heart-broken mother may
plead for them, she is not allowed to have them.
If the man does not wish to keep them he sends the
children with the mother, and if she marries again
the new husband does not expect to contribute
to the support of the children of the former
marriage.</p>

<p>There can be no pure home-life, as the children
are wise above their years in the knowledge of sin.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>Nothing is kept from them and they are perfectly
conversant with the personal history of their parents,
past and present.</p>

<p>A man may have a new wife every few months
if he so desires, and in some parts of Arabia this
is a common state of affairs among the rich chiefs.
The result of all this looseness of morals is indescribable.
Unnatural vice abounds, and so do contagious
diseases which are the inheritance of poor
little children.</p>

<p>There is a very large per cent. of infant mortality
partly on this account, and partly on account of
gross ignorance in the treatment of the diseases of
childhood.</p>

<p>Instead of a home full of love and peace, there is
dissension and distrust. The heart of the husband
does not trust his wife and she seeks to do him evil,
not good. For example, a woman is thought very
clever if she can cheat her husband out of his money
or capital, and lay it up for herself in case she is
divorced. There is nothing to bind them in sweet
communion and interchange of confidences. As a
rule, when a man and a woman marry they do not
look for mutual consideration and respect and
courtesy; marriage is rather looked upon as a good
or a bad bargain. That marriage has anything to
do with the affections does not often occur to them.
If only a man's passions can be satisfied and his
material needs provided, that is all he expects from
marriage.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>
<p>But I do not deny that there are grand though
not frequent exceptions to this evil system. I have
seen a man cling to his wife and love her and grieve
sadly when she died. And some Arab fathers dearly
love their daughters and mourn at the loss of one,
and the little girls show sincere affection for their
fathers. And yet all these bright spots only make
the general blackness of home-life seem more dense
and dismal.</p>

<p>Missionary schools and education in general have
done much in breaking up this system. Many
Moslems of the higher class are trying to justify the
grosser side of their book-religion by spiritualizing
the Koran teaching. But secular education will
never make a firm foundation for the elevation of
a nation or an individual. Those who have been
led to see the weakness of a religion that degrades
women, have gained their knowledge through the
Gospel.</p>

<p>The fact that attention is paid to suffering women
by medical missions is already changing the prevalent
idea that woman is inferior and worthless.
And although it may seem sometimes an impossible
task to ever raise these women to think higher
thoughts and to rise from the degradation of centuries,
yet we know from experience that those who
come in contact with Christian women soon learn
to avoid all unclean conversation in their presence.
Visiting them in their huts and homes is also a
means of breaking down prejudice. The daily clinic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>in the three mission hospitals of East Arabia, where
thousands of sick women receive as much attention
as do the men, is winning the hearts and opening
the eyes of many to see what disinterested love is.
They can scarcely understand what constrains Christian
women to go into such unlovely surroundings
and touch bodies loathsome from disease in the
dispensaries.</p>

<p>When the men have wisdom to perceive that the
education of their women and girls means the elevation
of their nation, and when they give the women
an opportunity to become more than mere animals,
then will the nation become progressive and alive to
its great possibilities. Reformation cannot come
from within but must come from without, from the
living power of the Christ. Are you not responsible
to God for a part in the evangelization of Arabia in
this generation?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Let none whom He hath ransomed fail to greet Him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through thy neglect unfit to see His face."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The following earnest words, from one who being
dead yet speaketh, are a plea for more workers to
come out to Arabia. Marion Wells Thoms, M. D.,
labored for five years in Arabia and wrote in one
of her last letters as follows:</p>

<p>"The Mohammedan religion has done much to
degrade womanhood. To be sure, female infanticide
formerly practised by the heathen Arabs was abol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>ished
by Islam, but that death was not so terrible as
the living death of thousands of the Arab women
who have lived since the reign of the 'merciful'
prophet, nor was its effect upon society in general
so demoralizing. In the 'time of ignorance,' that
is time before Mohammed, women often occupied
positions of honor. There were celebrated poetesses
and we read of Arab queens ruling their tribes.</p>

<p>"Such a state of things does not exist to-day, but
the woman's influence, though never recognized by
the men, is nevertheless indirectly a potent factor,
but never of a broadening or uplifting character.
To have been long regarded as naturally evil has
had a degrading influence. Mohammedan classical
writers have done their best to revile womanhood.
'May Allah never bless womankind' is a quotation
from one of them.</p>

<p>"Moslem literature, it is true, exhibits isolated
glimpses of a worthier estimation of womanhood,
but the later view, which comes more and more into
prevalence, is the only one which finds its expression
in the sacred tradition, which represents hell as full
of women, and refuses to acknowledge in its women,
apart from rare exceptions, either reason or religion,
in poems which refer all the evil in the world to the
woman as its root, in proverbs which represent a
careful education of girls as mere waste.</p>

<p>"When the learned ones ascribe such characteristics
to women, is it any wonder that they have
come to regard themselves as mere beasts of burden?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>The Arab boy spends ten or twelve years of his life
largely in the women's quarters, listening to their
idle conversation about household affairs and their
worse than idle talk about their jealousies and intrigues.</p>

<p>"When the boy becomes a man, although he has
absolute dominion over his wife as far as the right
to punish or divorce her is concerned, he often
yields to her decision in regard to some line of
action. In treating a woman I have sometimes appealed
to the husband to prevail upon his wife to
consent to more severe treatment than she was willing
to receive. After conversing with his wife his
answer has been, 'She will not consent,' and that
has been final. Lady Ann Blunt, who has travelled
among the Bedouins, says, 'In more than one
sheikh's tent it is the women's half of it in which the
politics of the tribe are settled.'</p>

<p>"In regard to their religion they believe what
they have been told or have heard read from the
Koran and other religious books. They do not
travel as much as the men, and do not have the
opportunity of listening to those who do, hence their
ideas are not changed by what they see and hear.
All the traditions of Mohammed and other heroes
are frequently rehearsed and implicitly believed.</p>

<p>"Although the Arab race is considered a strong
one, we find among the women every ill to which
their flesh is heir, unrelieved and oftentimes even
aggravated by their foolish native treatment. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>mother's heart cannot help but ache as she hears the
Arab mother tell of the loss of two, three, four, or
more of her children, the sacrifice perhaps to her
own ignorance. The physical need of the Arab
women is great and we pray that it may soon appeal
to some whose medical training fits them to administer
to this need in all parts of Arabia.</p>

<p>"In the towns in which there are missionaries
there are comparatively few houses in which they
are not welcomed. In our own station there are
more open houses than we have ever had time to
visit. Wherever women travellers, of whom there
have been two of some note, have gone, they have
been met with kindness; hence it will be seen that the
open door is not lacking."</p>

<p>Ignorance, superstition, and sensuality are the
characteristics which impress themselves most
strongly at first upon one who visits the Arab harem,
but there are those, too, among the women who are
really attractive. It is a dark picture, and we do
not urge the need of more workers because the
fields are white to harvest. We ask that more offer
themselves and be sent soon, rather, that, after they
have learned the difficult language, they may be able
to begin <i>to prepare the ground for seed-sowing</i>. It
is a work that can only be done by women, for
while the Bedouin women have greater freedom to
go about and converse with the men than the town
women have, and while some of the poorer classes
in the towns will allow themselves to be treated by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>man doctor, and sit and listen to an address made in
the dispensary, the better class are only accessible
in their houses. Their whole range of ideas is so
limited and so far below ours that it will require
"line upon line and precept upon precept" to teach
these women that there is a higher and better life
for them. In fact there must be the creation of the
desire for better things as far as most of them are
concerned, but love and tact accompanied by the
power of the Holy Spirit can win their way to these
hearts and accomplish the same results that have
been accomplished among other Oriental women.</p>

<p>I have been striving to show that there is a crying
need for work among the Arab women and that
there are ample opportunities for service. I appeal
to the women of the church whose sympathies have
so long gone out to heathen women everywhere, not
to have less sympathy for them, but to include Mohammedan
Arabia and her womanhood more and
more in their love, their gifts, and their prayers.
In the days of Mohammed, after the battle of
Khaibar, in which so many of her people had been
mercilessly slaughtered, Zeinab, the Jewess, who
prepared a meal for Mohammed and his men, put
poison in the mutton and all but caused the prophet's
death. It is said by some that he never fully recovered
from the effects of the poison, and that it
was an indirect cause of his death. It seems to us
who have lived and labored in the land of the false
prophet that his religion will only receive its death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>-blow
when Christian women rise to their duty and
privilege, and by love and sacrifice, not in vengeance
but in mercy, send the true religion to these our
neglected, degraded sisters,&mdash;sisters in Him who
"hath made of one blood all nations."</p>

<h2>WOMEN'S LIFE IN THE YEMEN</h2>


<p>The term "Yemen," meaning the land on the
right hand, is the name applied to that whole tract of
land in Arabia south of Mecca and west of the
Hadramaut, which has always been looked upon as a
dependency or province.</p>

<p>In early historical times the Yemen was occupied
by Homerites and other aborigines, but later on by
the Himyarites, who drove many of the original inhabitants
to seek a new home in Africa, where, having
intermarried with the Gallas, Kaffirs, and
Dankalis, they formed a new race which is generally
known nowadays as the Somali.</p>

<p>The physical conformation of the Yemen is not
unlike that of the portion of Africa immediately
opposite, where there is as great diversity in climate
and soil as there is in the manners and customs of
the peoples.</p>

<p>From Aden, the Eastern Gibraltar, right northward
there stretches a range of mountains chiefly
formed of igneous rocks that have been bent, torn,
and twisted like the iron girders of a huge building
that has been destroyed by fire and almost covered
by the ruin. Bare peak after peak rises from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>mass of débris yet everywhere pierced, scarred, and
seamed by the monsoon floods seeking their way to
the ocean bed; they seldom reach it, however, as a
stream and never as a river, because of the barren,
scorched, sandy zone which belts the Red Sea and
sucks into its huge maw everything that the hills
send down.</p>

<p>Like his country the Yemen Arab is girded about
with an arid zone of reserve which few Europeans
have ever crossed, but when they have managed to
do so, according to the individual they have met,
they have found it may be a man with a heart as
hard as a nether millstone. Marrying one day and
divorcing almost the next, only to marry another as
soon as he can scrape together sufficient funds to
purchase a wife, this type of man looks upon woman
as an inferior animal formed for man's gratification,
and to be flung aside like a sucked orange when the
juice is gone.</p>

<p>Or on the other hand, they may find men whom
real love has saved and made to give forth warm
affection and true domestic joy, just as the terraced
ridges on their mountain slopes retain the God-given
moisture and send forth a luxuriant crop of
strengthening cereals, delicious coffee, and luscious
grapes.</p>

<p>I have known young men of twenty-four who
have been married and divorced half a dozen times,
and also Arabs whose days are in the sere and yellow
leaf who never had but one wife.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>
<p>There was a native chief who used to come occasionally
to our dispensary whose children were numbered
by three figures, and Khan Bahadur Numcherjee
Rustomjee, C. I. E., who was for many years a
magistrate in Aden, told me he knew a woman who
had been legally married more than fifty times and
had actually forgotten the names of the fathers of
two of her children!</p>

<p>One day an Arab brought a fine-looking woman to
our dispensary, and as he was very kind to her and
seemed to love her very much I ventured to tell him
that she was suffering from diabetes mellitus, and
that in order to preserve her life he would require to
be careful with her diet. He thanked me most profoundly,
promised to do all that he could for her,
took her home and divorced her the same day, casting
her off in the village and leaving her without a
copper.</p>

<p>Next morning she came weeping to the dispensary
and I tried to get compensation, but the man pleaded
poverty, and because I was the cause of her plight
I felt in duty bound to support her until she died
some months later.</p>

<p>Another man of more than fifty years carried
the wife of his youth to our dispensary on his back.
She was suffering from Bright's disease and ascites,
yet he toiled on and till now has shown no sign of
wavering in his allegiance. Warm-hearted, courteous,
and kind, I look upon him as one of nature's
noblemen whom even Mohammedanism cannot spoil.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>
<p>Another man whose wife had an ovarian tumor
brought her down from Hodeidah for me to operate
on, and faithfully attended to all her wants while
she was ill, and at last when the wound caused by
operation was healed, took her home joyfully as a
bridegroom takes home the bride of his choice.</p>

<p>A third man, who had either two or three wives at
the time, called me to see one who had been in labor
for six days. When the Arab midwives confessed
that they could do nothing more for her and when he
saw her sinking, love triumphed over prejudice, and
he came hurriedly for me. I performed a Cæsarean
section, and so earned the gratitude of both husband
and wife, who, though years have gone, still
take a warm interest in all that concerns the mission.</p>

<p>I wish, however, that I could say that cases like
these were common experiences with me, but unfortunately
the reverse is the case. Men seem always
ashamed to speak of their wives and when
wanting medicine for them or me to visit them
always speak of them as, "my family"&mdash;"the mother
of my children"&mdash;"my uncle's daughters," or like
circumlocution. Once I boxed a boy's ears for
speaking of his own mother as his "father's cow!"</p>

<p>Brought up in ignorance, unable to read, write,
sew, or do fancy work&mdash;in all my experience out
here I have never known of a real Arab girl being
sent to school nor a real Arab woman who knew the
alphabet. Sold at a marriageable age, in many
cases to the highest bidder, then kept closely secluded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>in the house, is it any wonder that her health is
undermined and when brought to child-bed there
is no strength left?</p>

<p>Called one day to see a Somali woman I missed
the whip usually seen in a Somali's house, and jokingly
asked how her husband managed to keep her
in order without a whip. She, taking her husband
and me by the hand, said, "You are my father and
this is my husband. Love unites us, and where love
is there is no need for whips."</p>

<p>I was so pleased with her speech that I offered her
husband, who was out of work, a subordinate place
in our dispensary. Yet less than a month later I
heard that he had divorced his wife and turned
her out of doors.</p>

<p>The following case will, I think, illustrate the
usual attitude of the Arabs in the Yemen towards
womankind:</p>

<p>A man whose wife had been in labor two days
came asking for medicine to make her well. My
reply was that it was necessary to see the woman
before I could give such a drug as he wished.
"Well," said he, "she will die before I allow you or
any other man to see her," and two days after I
heard of her death.</p>

<p>I have often remonstrated with the men for keeping
their wives so closely confined and for not delighting
in their company, and making them companions
and friends. But almost invariably I have
been answered thus, "The Prophet (upon whom be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>blessing and peace) said, 'Do not trouble them with
what they cannot bear, for they are prisoners in
your hands whom you took in trust from God.'"
And therefore as prisoners they are to be kept and
treated as being of inferior intellect.</p>

<p>I have known cases where a man gave his daughter
in marriage on condition that the bridegroom
would never marry another wife; but the man broke
his word and married a second wife, whereupon he
was summoned before the kadi, who ruled that,
"When a man marries a woman on condition that
he would not marry another at the same time with
her, the contract is valid and the condition void because
it makes unlawful what is lawful, and God
knoweth all."</p>

<p>The consequence of such laws is that the women
become prone to criminal intrigues, and I have
known dozens of cases where mothers have helped
their daughters and even acted as procuresses for
them to avenge some slight upon them or injury
done to them. There is no fear of God before their
eyes. Heaven to them is little better than a place of
prostitution. Why, then, should they desire it?
Here they know the bitterness of being one of two
or three wives, why then should they wish to be
"one of seventy"?</p>

<h2>PEN-AND-INK SKETCHES IN PALESTINE</h2>


<p>Sir William Muir, who lived for forty years in
India, says: "The sword of Islam and the Koran
are the most obstinate foes to civilization, liberty,
and truth the world has yet known." After a residence
of nearly twenty years in Palestine and much
intercourse among all classes, both in city and village
life, the writer of this chapter can confirm the
statement.</p>

<p>Islam is the same everywhere and changes not.</p>

<p>The chief cause of its blighting influence is its
degradation and contempt of women, which is the
result of ignorance of the Word of God. <i>Therefore,
the wide-spread preaching of the Gospel to-day is
the need of Islam</i>, and the responsibility for it
rests chiefly upon the Christians of England and
America.</p>

<p>One looks in vain among Moslems for peaceful
homes, honored wives, affectionate husbands, happy
sons and daughters, loving and trusting one another.</p>

<p>A Moslem home is built upon the foundation of
the man's right (<i>religious right</i>) to have at least
four wives at a time; to divorce them at pleasure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>and to bring others as frequently as he has the inclination
or the money to buy.</p>

<p>A son is always welcomed at birth with shrill
shouts and boisterous clapping of hands or beating
of drums; but a baby girl is received in silence and
disappointment.</p>

<p>The boy is indulged in every way from the day of
his arrival. He is under no restraint or control,
and usually at two years of age is a little tyrant,
freely cursing his mother and sisters. The mother
smiles at his cleverness, she herself having taught
him, and her own teaching leads afterwards to much
misery in the lives of other women.</p>

<p>Great numbers of boys die in infancy, or under
three years of age, because of the ignorance of their
mothers in caring for them. They are either overfed
or neglected. In some families, where there
have been a number of both boys and girls, all the
boys have died. The women have been blamed for
this and sometimes divorced, or else retained to
serve the new wives who have been brought instead.</p>

<p>How often I think of the dear little Moslem girls!
The most teachable and responsive to loving kindness
of all. Oh, that they might have happy homes,
happy mothers, wise and loving fathers! One dear
Moslem child, only four years old, after having been
in a Christian mission school for a year, was taken
ill and died. All the members of a large family
were present as she lay dying (crowding into the
room of the sick is an Oriental custom) and heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>her exclaim: "My mother! Jesus loves little girls
just like me!"</p>

<p>A Moslem can divorce his wife at his pleasure or
send her away from his house without a divorce. If
he does only the latter, she cannot marry any one
else. This is often done purposely to torment her.
But the women are not the only sufferers through
these wretched domestic arrangements. Many of
them are utterly heartless and show no pity for
their own children. They will leave them to marry
again, the new husband refusing to take the children,
and numbers die in consequence. Many a
troublesome old man is also put out of the way by
poison administered by the wives of his sons. Not
long ago a prison, in an Oriental city, was visited
by some Christian missionaries who had obtained
permission to see the women who had been sentenced
for life. They are found to be there for having
murdered their "da-râ-ir," that is, their husbands'
other wives, or the children of their hated
rivals; and, having no money, they had not been
able to buy their way out of prison, as can be done
and is customary in Moslem countries.</p>

<p>As the camera would not do full justice to
Moslem "interiors," either in house-life or in the
administration of public affairs, both also being
difficult to obtain, a few "pen and ink" sketches
are sent by the writer of this article, taken in person
on the spot.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of Abu Ali's household. Abu
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>Ali has two wives, Aisha and Amina. Confusion and
every evil thing are found in his family life. Each
wife has five children, large and small, and the ten
of the two families all hate each other. They fight
and bite, scratch out each other's eyes, and pull out
each other's hair. The husband has good houses
and gardens but the women and children all live in
dark, damp rooms on the ground floor. The writer
knows them and often goes to see them, especially to
comfort the older wife, whose life is very wretched.
She is almost starved at times. She weeps many
bitter tears and curses the religion into which she
was born. The Prophet Mohammed's religion makes
many a man a heartless tyrant. He is greatly to
be pitied because a victim by inheritance to this
vast system of evil. Wild animals show more affection
for their offspring and certainly take (for
a while at least) more responsibility for their young
than many Moslems do in Palestine.</p>

<p>Werdie is another case. This name in Arabic
means "a rose." There are many sweet young roses
in the East but, hidden away among thorns and
brambles, their fragrance is often lost. This
Werdie, a fair young blue-eyed girl whose six own
brothers had all died, lived with her mother and
father and his other wives in a very large Oriental
house (not a <i>home</i>). She lived in the midst of
continual strife, cursings, "evil eyes," and fights.
This household is a distinguished family in their
town!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>
<p>Sometimes the quarrels lasted for many days
without cessation and Werdie always took part in
them as her mother's champion. The quarrels were
between her father's wives,&mdash;her mother's rivals,&mdash;and
she often boasted that she could hold out longer
than all the others combined against her. On one
occasion her awful language and loud railings continued
for three days, and then she lost her voice&mdash;utterly&mdash;and
could not speak for weeks! She had
an ungoverned temper, and when goaded by the
cruel injustice done her mother she delighted to give
vent to it; but she also had a conscience and a good
mind and was led into the Light. On being told
of the power in Jesus Christ to overcome, she said
one day, "I will try Him. I want peace in my heart,
I will do anything to get it; I believe in Him and
I will trust Him," and she did. She was afterwards
given in marriage by her father, against her wish, to
a man she did not know. He treats her cruelly as
does also her mother-in-law. But now she has
another spirit, a meek and lowly one, and is truly
a follower of the Lord Jesus Christ. In the midst
of strife she is a silent sufferer and a marvel to all
the members of her family. She prays much and
has literally a broken and a contrite spirit. She is
the Lord's. There are other roses among the Moslems
whom Jesus Christ came to redeem. Let us
pray for them and go and find them! <i>He will point
the way</i>.</p>

<p>Saleh Al Wahhâb is a Moslem in good position
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>with ample means. He first married a sweet-looking
young girl, Belise by name, but she had no children,
so he divorced her and married three other
women. Not having his desire for children granted,
he divorced all three of these women and took back
his first wife, who was quite willing to go to him!</p>

<p>Haji Hamid, who made the pilgrimage to
Mecca, was the chief of a Matâwaly village and
highly honored, belonging to the Shiah sect of
Moslems. He has had many wives, some of
whom he had divorced because they displeased him,
and others had died. When he became an old
man, he brought a young and, as he was assured by
others, a very beautiful and virtuous bride. He had
never seen her. He paid a large sum of money for
her, most of which she wore afterwards as ornaments&mdash;gold
coins&mdash;on her head and neck.</p>

<p>Soon after her arrival in the sheikh's house he
became seriously ill. She found this unpleasant, as
she was a bride and wanted to enjoy herself. So
she ran away, taking all the gold with her, and left
him to die!</p>

<p>There is no honor or truth among Moslems. The
Prophet's religion does not and cannot implant pity
or compassion in the human heart. Haji Hamid had
inherited from his birth false teaching, the evil influences
and results of lying, corruption in Government
affairs, tyranny, bribery, bigotry, and contempt
for women. He only reaped as he had sown.
However, he heard the Gospel on his dying bed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>seemed grateful for kindnesses shown to him by
Christian strangers.</p>

<p>Abd Er Rahim, "Slave of the Merciful," was a
rich Moslem who once had several wives. Some
he had divorced, some he had sent back to their
fathers' homes, and some had died, and he was
tired of the one who remained because she was
getting old.</p>

<p>By chance he had seen a very handsome young
peasant girl, and he wanted her, but he was afraid
of his wife, for he felt sure that she would be troublesome
if he brought this young girl to his house.
So he planned a "shimel-howa" for his wife (a
pleasant time, literally, a "smelling of the air," a
promenade), to which she readily agreed. She put
on her jewelry and silk outer garments, and started.
Her husband was to follow her, but, according to
Moslem custom, at a distance, as a man is not seen
in public with his wife. She never returned, but
was found dead two days afterwards, drowned in
a well, wearing all her jewelry. Her husband found
her. The facts were never investigated. A few
days afterwards the new wife was brought into the
house and lived there until the death of Abd Er
Rahim. He has now gone to his reward! He
never knew anything about the Lord Jesus Christ.
No one ever told him. His last wife, however, did
have the opportunity of knowing, but she laughed
and made fun of His name. When she died, about
three years ago, twenty large jars of water were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>poured over her to wash away her sins. She was
arrayed in several silk gowns and buried, with verses
from the Koran written on paper placed in her
dead hands, to keep evil spirits away from her soul.
Such is their ignorant superstition.</p>

<p>Benda was a poor Moslem woman who lived in a
goat's-hair tent on one of the plains mentioned in
the Bible, a Bedouin Arab's cast-off wife. She
had lost her only child, her son, a young man.
When first found, she herself was a mere skeleton.
Very deaf and clothed in rags, she sat on the
ground, weeping bitterly over the two long black
braids of hair of her dead son, a pitiful object. It
was very difficult to make her hear, but she was
taught, often amidst the roars of laughter of some
nominal Christians who said to her teacher: "Why
do you cast pearls before swine?"</p>

<p>However, Benda was one of His jewels. She had
a hungry heart, she understood the truth, believed,
and was saved and comforted. Before she "went
up higher" she became a "witness" to some of her
own people.</p>

<p>There are other Moslem Bendas yet to be found,
others to be brought into the fold. Who will come
to help to find them and to bring them in? The
lost sheep of the house of Ishmael.</p>

<p>Some one has asked: "What happens to the cast-off
wives and divorced women among the Moslems?"
Sometimes they are married several times
and divorced by several men. If they have no chil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>dren,
after their strength fails them so that they
cannot work, they beg and lead a miserable existence,
and die. A woman who has lived at ease and
in high position, after being divorced, will sometimes
reach the very lowest degrees of poverty, hunger,
and misery, and then die. For such, there are
no funeral expenses; nothing is required but a shallow
grave. Moslem men are usually willing to dig
that in their own burying ground, and the body is
carried to its last resting place on the public
"ma'ash," or bier. Benda was buried in this way,
but "she had an inheritance incorruptible and that
fadeth not away."<br /><br /></p>

<p><br />Sheikh Haj Hamid's story is that of a rescued
Moslem. Let me tell it to you.</p>

<p>There is to-day in the far East a town built out
of the ruins of a city of great antiquity, in the land
where giants once lived, and King Og reigned
(Genesis xiv. 5; Deuteronomy iii. 11, 13).</p>

<p>Some of the Lord's messengers went out there,
recently, to gather into the fold any of His scattered
and wandering sheep they might find. Probably
the Gospel had not been preached there for
one thousand five hundred years. The Lord had
promised to go before His messengers, and had
assured them that there were sheep in that place
who would hear His voice and follow Him, and,
trusting this sure guidance, they started. "In
journeyings, often, in perils of water, in perils of
robbers, in perils in the wilderness, in perils among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>false brethren," they searched for the sheep and
lambs&mdash;and found them. One of the number was a
dignified, gray-haired Moslem sheikh who, on hearing
"the call," with groans and tears asked, "What
must I do to be saved, for my sins reach up to
Heaven? What am I to do with them? For forty
long years I have gone daily to the mosque, but
never before, until this day, have I heard of salvation
in Jesus Christ." And he wept aloud and
cried out: "Won't you pray for me?" He eagerly
received instruction and believed. His last and oft
repeated words to his new-found Christian friends,
as they rode away, were: "Won't you continue to
pray for me?"</p>

<p>The Lord Jesus Christ is speaking to His own
among Moslems to-day, but many have never heard
of Him. There are more than two hundred million
Moslems in the world. "How can they hear
without a preacher?"</p>

<p>Hindîyea's story will also interest you. A Moslem
woman lay dying in a coast town of old Syro-Ph&oelig;nicia.
She was the wife of an aged Kâtib&mdash;the
scribe of the town and the teacher of the Koran.
The woman knew that her end was near, but how
could she die? Where was she going? Her husband
had no word of comfort for her, he did not
know. She was greatly troubled and deep waters
rolled over her soul. Who could tell her? Was
there no one to stretch out a helping hand?</p>

<p>Suddenly she thought of a foreign lady, a mis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>sionary,
who was at the time in her own town, and
whose words had once strangely stirred her heart.
Perhaps she would come to her? She did come
and on her entering the room, Hindîyea, endued
with new strength and wonderful energy, sat up in
her bed and called out in a loud voice, her great
eyes shining like stars: "Welcome! Welcome! a
thousand times welcome! I need you now, can you
teach me how to die? Will you come and put your
hands on my head and bring down God's blessing
upon me? Surely you can help me."</p>

<p>Hindîyea was told just in time the Way, the
Truth, and the Life, and went home to God. Christ
came for others just like her in the great Moslem
world. Who will go to teach them how to die
and how to live?</p>

<p>There is a general belief among Christians that
Moslems worship the One True God&mdash;the Almighty
God; but this is a mistake, they do not worship
Him at all! They worship the God who has Mohammed
for his prophet and <i>who is he</i>? Certainly
not the God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>The call that goes up from thousands of minarets
all over the Moslem world six times a day&mdash;"There
is no God but God, and Mohammed is his prophet,"&mdash;is
in direct conflict with the Word of Truth, that
we have access to our God through His Son, Jesus
Christ, for they deny the Son,&mdash;"and this is the
record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and
this life is in His Son. He that hath the Son hath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>life, and he that hath not the Son of God hath not
life" (1 John v. 11, 12).</p>

<p>"Who is the liar, but he that denieth that Jesus
is the Christ. This is the Anti-Christ, that denieth
the Father and the Son. Whosoever denieth the
Son the same hath not the Father: he that confesseth
the Son hath the Father also" (1 John ii.
22, 23).</p>

<p>In direct contradiction to this teaching of the
New Testament is Chapter CXII of the Koran,
which, in Sale's translation, is as follows: "My God
is one God, the eternal God, He begetteth not,
neither is He begotten, and there is not any one like
unto Him." Also in Chapter XIX: "It is not meet
for God that he should have any Son, God forbid!"
Chapter CXII is held in particular veneration by the
Mohammedan world and declared by the tradition
of their prophet to be equal in value to a third part
of the whole Koran. Wherever Islam prevails, or
exists, Christ is denied to be the Son of God. All
Moslems deny also the death on the Cross and the
resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>There is a clarion call to-day for prayer, prayer
for the Moslem World. When the Christians of
evangelical lands begin to pray, the walls of the
strongholds of the enemy will fall, and the chains
that have bound millions of souls for one thousand
three hundred years will be broken.</p>

<p>Islam's only hope is to know God, "the Only True
God, and Jesus Christ whom He has sent."</p>

<h2>ONCE MORE IN PALESTINE</h2>


<p>The condition of all Moslem women must necessarily
be more or less sad (for under the very best
conditions it can never be secure), yet I think that
the lot of Moslem women in Palestine compares
favorably with that of their sisters in India. There
is less absolute cruelty. There are fewer atrocious
customs. The lot of widows is easier, and girls are
not altogether despised.</p>

<p>Polygamy is lawful, yet this custom is certainly
decreasing with education and civilization. The
Turks have very seldom more than one wife. My
experience of the officials who come from Turkey
to hold office in Palestine, both civil and military,
tells me that it is now the fashion among enlightened
Moslems to follow European ways in the matter
of marriage, and I observe that, when men are
educated and have travelled, they seldom care for a
plurality of wives.</p>

<p>However, among the Arabic-speaking inhabitants
of Palestine men with more than one wife, both
rich and poor, may still be found.</p>

<p>Among the uneducated rich men (and by the term
uneducated, I mean those who have not completed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>their studies in Egypt or Europe) you will often
find one having two wives. Also among the landowners,
or sheikhs of villages, who travel from place
to place to overlook their property, you will be told
that they have a wife in each village living with a
suitable retinue of servants. The Arabic word for
the second wife means "the one that troubles me."
This word is used in 1 Samuel i. in the story of
Hannah, and is translated "adversary." I know of
an educated gentleman, living in a large city, who
added a young bride to his family, but his first wife
was treated with every consideration. The rich can
afford to put their wives in different suites of
apartments with different servants, and by this
means quarrelling is prevented; but the case is very
different among the poor.</p>

<p>Not long ago a sad case came under my own
notice. A prosperous pharmacist was married to
a very nice woman, and they were a happy couple
with sons and daughters growing up around them.
By degrees, the wife perceived a change in her husband's
temper. If anything went wrong, he immediately
threatened her, not with divorce, but to
introduce a second wife into their happy home.
This threat he finally carried out, and the wife had
the chagrin of welcoming the bride, and she was
obliged to behave pleasantly over the business.
These two women appear to live in harmony, there
is no alternative, for over the first wife Damocles'
sword hangs but by a hair. But you can imagine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>the bitterness in her heart, her anger against the
husband, and her hatred of the bride. You can
imagine also the loss of respect for their father
which the sons will feel.</p>

<p>Among the poorer classes it is the usual thing
to find a man with two wives. One of these is old.
She acts as housekeeper, and is consulted and considered
by the husband. The other is usually quite
a young woman, who must obey the older wife and
treat her as a mother-in-law. These two are generally
fairly happy, and, as a rule, live in peace. I
have seen a man with three wives, all under the
same roof. He acts impartially to all&mdash;but the
quarrelling among themselves and among their
children in his absence is very sad. The effect of
polygamy upon the home is most disastrous. What
effect it may have on the domestic happiness of the
man I cannot say, but one can make a guess and
that not a very favorable one!</p>

<p>Divorce is easy, inexpensive, and very prevalent;
and it is no uncommon thing to hear that a man has
had ten or eleven wives and that a woman has had
eight or nine husbands. For an angry man to say
the words, "I divorce you," and to repeat them
three times, swearing an oath by the Prophet, is
enough to oblige the object of his wrath to leave his
house; carrying with her a bed, a pillow, a coverlet,
and a saucepan, together with the clothes which
she had from her own family at her marriage. She
returns to her father's house, or to the nearest rela<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>tion
she has, should he be dead, until another marriage
is arranged for her.</p>

<p>Among the richer classes divorce seldom occurs;
and, if the wife has children and devotes herself
to the comfort of her husband, she may feel her
position tolerably secure. Should she fall ill, however,
it is rare that a husband permits her to remain
in his house, for he has not promised to cherish her
in sickness and in health. He will send her to her
own family till he sees how the illness will turn;
and, more than probably, she will be told in less
than a month that she is divorced, and that her husband
has married another. How often in our Palestine
hospitals do we try to comfort and soothe the
poor sick women in their feverish anxiety to get
well, for fear of this dreaded Damocles' sword falling
on their unhappy heads!</p>

<p>Among the poorer classes divorce is extremely
prevalent. If a woman has no child, she is immediately
divorced, and is returned to her own family,
who arrange for a second marriage, generally in
about ten days from the time she is divorced.
Should she again have no child, her lot will indeed
be a sad one. She must then be content to be the
wife of some blind or crippled man, who, perhaps,
will also exact a sum of money from her relations
for his charity in marrying her. If a woman be
divorced after she has had children, she must leave
them with the husband, to be probably harshly
treated by her successor or successors. If the father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>dies, the children are supported by his brothers or
relations, while the widow marries again. It is seldom
that a widow is permitted to take a child, or
children, to her new home. There is no difficulty
in providing for orphan girls; they are much sought
after in marriage, for the law excuses a young man
from foreign military service if he can prove that
his wife is an orphan. This means that he would
not be able to leave her alone during his absence.
Such orphans are generally taken into the houses of
their future husbands as little tiny girls of four or
five years old, where they are trained by the mother-in-law,
and grow up as daughters. By this means
the husband is exempt from paying any sum of
money for his bride.</p>

<p>We must not forget that the marriages of Moslems
are wholly without affection, and that the only
way in which the husband can enforce obedience
from his ignorant and listless wife is by the law of
divorce. She will obey him and work for him
simply from the fear of being turned away. When
a woman has been divorced four or five times, she
finds a difficulty in getting a husband; for the report
spreads that it "takes two to make a quarrel,"
that her tongue is too sharp and her temper too
short. I have been asked what becomes eventually
of the woman who has been frequently divorced.
Finally she remains with the old or very poor man
who has married her in her old age. Or, possibly,
if she is a widow with a grown-up son, he will sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>port
her until death relieves him of what he feels
to be only a burden. The insecurity of a Moslem
wife's position quite precludes any improvement in
herself, her household arrangements, or in her children's
training. She does not care to sew, or to
take an interest in her husband's work. She does
not economize, or try to improve his position, for
fear that, if he should find himself with a little spare
money, he would immediately enlarge his borders
by taking another wife! Therefore, a Moslem
woman's house is always poor-looking and untidy.
She keeps her husband's clothes the same, that he
may not be able to associate with wealthy men and
envy their pleasures. Here we see the wide gulf between
Christianity and Islam. The wife, whom
God gave to be the "help," and whose price is far
above rubies, has been debased by the prophet Mohammed,
into the "chattel" to be used, and when
worn out, thrown away!</p>

<p>The Christian woman's home in Palestine is generally
clean and tidy. Her interests are identical
with those of her husband. She is glad to work
to help the man, that the position of both may be
improved.</p>

<p>I do not think the rich man ill-treats his wife. I
have found him invariably kind and indulgent. In
Palestine the women have plenty of liberty. It is
a mistake to say that they are shut up. To begin
with, they live in large houses with gardens and
courtyards enclosed. They go out visiting one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>another, to the public baths, and to the cemetery
regularly once a week, where they meet and commune
with the spirits of departed friends.</p>

<p>The girls go to school regularly. The richer
Moslems have resident governesses for their daughters,
and they are eager for education. There is
no doubt that the customs are changing. Education
is raising the woman, and the man will naturally
appreciate the change and will welcome companionship
and culture. To educate both men and
women is the best way of checking the evil system
of polygamy, and its daughter, divorce. Polygamy
was promulgated by the Prophet as a bribe to the
carnal man. Without that carnal weapon I doubt if
Islam had numbered a thousand followers! It ministers
to self-gratification in this world, and promises
manifold more of the same license in the world to
come. It is small wonder that when we speak of a
clean heart and a right spirit without which we
cannot enter the spiritual kingdom, our words are
unintelligible. But that is our theme. Holiness,
without which no man can see the Lord! These
poor women are so ignorant. They know that sin
has entered into the world, but they know not Him
who has destroyed the power of sin. They have
never heard the words, "Fear not, I have redeemed
thee." ...<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Moslem and Christian Girls Reading Together</span></span>
</div>

<p><br />The following are the words of another writer:</p>

<p>Never believe people who tell you Moslem women
are happy and well-off. I have lived among them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>for nearly eighteen years and know something of
their sad lives.</p>

<p>A Moslem girl is unwelcome at her birth and
oppressed throughout her life. When a child is
born in a family the first question asked is, "Is it
a boy or girl?" If the answer is, "A boy," congratulations
follow from friends and neighbors. But if
the answer is, "A girl," all commiserate the mother
in words such as, "God have mercy on thee."</p>

<p>As the little one grows up she has to learn her
place as inferior to her brothers, and that she must
always give in to them and see the best of everything
given to them.</p>

<p>I am glad to say that Christian missions have
made it possible for her to go to school if she lives
in a town. But at the age of ten she is probably
taken away from her mother, the only real friend
she is likely to have in the world, and sold by her
male relations into another family where she becomes
what is virtually a servant to her mother-in-law.
We know that mothers-in-law even in England
have not always a good name, but what may
they be to a young girl completely under their power?
Many are the sad stories I have heard of constant
quarrelling, followed on the part of the little bride
by attempts to run away to her old home, and the
advent of her relations on the scene of strife, to
patch up a reconciliation and induce the girl to submit
to her fate.</p>

<p>Perhaps you say, "Why does her husband not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>protect his wife from unkindness, does he not care
for her?" There you strike upon the root of a Moslem
woman's unhappiness. The boy husband has no
choice in his bride, has probably never set eyes on
her until the marriage day. He seems to care little
about her beyond making use of her. She is to be
his attendant to serve him and provide him with
sons. As to the first, I have watched one of these
girls in a merchant's house in Jerusalem standing in
attendance on her young husband's toilet, handing
him whatever he wanted, and folding up his thrown-off
clothes. But I looked in vain for the least sign
of kindly recognition of her attentions from him in
look or word or deed. The Moslem thinks it beneath
his dignity to speak to his wife except to give
orders, and does not answer her questions. It is not
customary for them to sit down to meals together,
and as for going for a walk together it would be
scandalous! One must not even ask a man after his
wife in public and she may not go out to visit
friends without his permission, and then veiled so
thickly as to be unrecognizable. The higher her
social rank the greater the seclusion for a Moslem
woman.</p>

<p>Then, as to her motherhood. The young wife's
thoughts are continually directed to the importance
of pleasing her husband and avoiding the corporal
punishment which accompanies his anger. If she
does not bear him a son she is in danger of divorce
or of the arrival of a co-wife brought to the house.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>It is strange that the latter trial seems to be faced
preferably to the former, which is a great disgrace.</p>

<p>A Moslem wife has no title until she has a son,
and then she is called the "mother of so-and-so,"
instead of being called by the name of her husband.
But she soon regrets the day he was born, for he
defies her authority and repulses her embraces. I
have seen a boy of four years old go into the street
to bring a big stone to throw at his mother with
curses! The mothers soon age. Their chief pleasures
are smoking and gossip.</p>

<p>Their religion is very scanty. Some know the
Moslem form of worship with its prostrations and
genuflexions. Most of them know the names of the
chief prophets, including that of Jesus Christ, and
believe that Mohammed's intercession will rescue
them from hell. I once asked a rich Moslem lady
what was woman's portion in paradise, but she did
not know.</p>

<p>Does this little description stir your pity? Are
we to leave these, our sisters, alone to their fate?
To suffer not only in this life but also in the life
to come? If you saw their daily life, and knew the
peace of God yourself, I think you would want to
do something to cheer them, by telling them Christ
loves them too, and that there is a great future before
them in Him and His Gospel.</p>

<h2>MOHAMMEDAN WOMEN IN SYRIA</h2>


<p>Syria is one of the countries bound down by the
heavy chain which Mohammedanism binds on the
East. The weight of this chain presses most heavily
on that which is weakest and least capable of resistance,
and that means the hearts of the women
who are born into this bondage.</p>

<p>There are probably from 1,200,000 to 1,500,000
Mohammedans in Syria, and this estimate also includes
the sects of the Nusairiyeh (the mountain
people in North Syria), the Metawileh, and the
Druzes, who, though differing in many ways from
the true Mohammedans, are yet classed with them
politically. When the word "Christian" is used in
this chapter it should be understood as distinguishing
a person or a sect which is neither Jew, Druse,
or Mohammedan, and does not necessarily imply, as
with us, a true spiritual disciple of the Lord Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>Our purpose is to show the condition of the Mohammedan
and Druze women in Syria to-day as far
as it has been possible to ascertain the facts which
have been gleaned from those most qualified to give
them. From a casual survey one may very likely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>come to the conclusion that conditions in Syria are
better and the lives of the women brighter than their
co-religionists in other Mohammedan lands. There
are happy homes (or so they seem at first sight)
where there is immaculate cleanliness, where the
mother looks well after the ways of her household
and her children, is ready to receive her husband and
kiss his hand when he returns from his work, where
there is but one wife, and a contented and indulgent
husband and father. When you come to look more
closely you will find in almost every case that more
or less light has come into these homes from Christian
teaching or example. There are many instances
on record of Mohammedan men testifying that the
girls trained in Christian schools make the best
wives. More than once have they come to thank
and bless the Protestant teachers who have taught
to their pupils such lessons of neatness, gentleness,
obedience, and self-control. There are many Mohammedan
men who are worthy to have refined,
educated wives, and can appreciate the blessing of
the homes such are capable of making. On the
other hand, however, there is a very large proportion
who need to be educated themselves in order to know
how to treat such women and who have the deserved
reputation of being brutal, sensual, unspeakably vile
in language and behavior. Many of these belong to
the better class in the large inland cities. The
women who are at the mercy of the caprices and
passions of such men are very greatly to be pitied.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>
<p>In the towns along the coast, where there
is more enlightenment; the women have more
freedom and seem outwardly happier than those
who are more strictly secluded in the towns where
Mohammedanism is the predominant influence.
Freedom, however, is used as a comparative term,
for the following was told to me to show what
privileges are accorded under that name to the
upper-class women in one of the smaller coast
cities. They are allowed to go often, every day
if they like, and sit by the graves in the Mohammedan
cemetery. When you consider the fact
that they are shrouded in their long "covers" or
cloaks, with faces veiled, and that the cemetery is
not a cheerful place, to say the least, and that it is the
only place where they are allowed to go, this so-called
"freedom" does not seem to be so very wonderful,
after all. However, it is far better than being
shut indoors all the time.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Family Group at Jericho</span></span>
</div>

<p><br />Any one living among these people becomes gradually
accustomed to the accepted state of things, especially
when one has learned that outside interference
only makes matters worse, and it is only now and
then when some especially sad or heart-rending thing
comes to your knowledge that you realize how truly
dreadful the whole system is. The other day I was
talking about this with a friend whose knowledge of
Mohammedan women had been confined to a few
families who on the outside would compare very
favorably with Christian families she knew, as re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>gards
comfort, cleanliness, and contentment. I
agreed with her that there were many of the nominal
Christian families where there certainly was great
unhappiness. But one must not, in comparing the
two, lose sight of the bitterest, darkest side. No
Christian woman has to contend with the fact that
if her husband wearies of her, or some carelessness
displeases him, he is perfectly at liberty to cast
her off as he would toss aside an old shoe. In fact
he would use the same expression in speaking of his
shoe, of a dog, some loathsome object, the birth of
a daughter or of his wife,&mdash;an expression of apology
for referring to such contaminating subjects. Nor
does a Christian woman fear that as the years pass
and her beauty fades, or her husband prospers, that
one day he will cause preparations to be made and
bring a new wife home. The Mohammedans have
a proverb that a man's heart is as hard as a blow
from the elbow, and that his love lasts not more than
two months.</p>

<p>A Mohammedan friend was telling me of a
woman she knew and was fond of. "She was a
good wife and mother," she said, "and she was
very happy with her two children, a boy and a
girl; her husband seemed to love her, for she is not
old, and it was a great surprise to her when he told
her one day that he was going to marry another
wife, for she had forgotten that it might be. He
said he would take a separate room for the new
wife. She said nothing&mdash;what could she say? But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>he deceived her, for he only took the room for the
new wife for one week, and then he brought her to
live with the first wife. And now she weeps all the
time, and oh! how unhappy they all are! I tell her
not to weep, for her husband will weary of her and
divorce her." A shadow crossed the face of my
friend as she spoke, and I could see she was thinking
of her own case, and fearing the fear of all Mohammedan
women. "Why did that man take another
wife when he was happy and had children?"
I asked, for I knew that where there are no children
a man feels justified in divorcing his wife, or taking
a second, third, or fourth. "He wanted more children.
Two were not enough."</p>

<p>Can there be any real happiness for a Mohammedan
woman? She gets little comfort from her
religion, although if she is a perfectly obedient wife,
attends faithfully to her religious duties, and does
not weep if her child dies, she has a hope that she
may be one of seventy houris who will have the
privilege of attending upon her lord and master in
his sensual paradise. The idea of these two horrors,
divorce and other wives to share her home, is constantly
before her.</p>

<p>A Protestant woman recently told me that she had
let some of her rooms to a Mohammedan family
from Hums. The man was intelligent and the wife
was an attractive young woman with a little girl.
The man told her in the presence of his wife that
when he went back to Hums he thought he should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>take another wife. "Why do you do that when
you are so happy as you are? Think of your wife&mdash;how
unhappy it would make her to have you bring
in another!" The man laughed and told her that
she made a great mistake in thinking that Mohammedan
women were like Christian women, that they
did not mind having another woman in the house,
they were accustomed to it and brought up to expect
it. "But I hope that what I said will make him
think and perhaps he will decide not to take another
wife, for I showed him plainly the evil of it."</p>

<p>The women may be brought up to expect it,&mdash;they
may have been the members of a polygamous
family themselves,&mdash;but the human heart is the same
the world over, and the sanctity of the home with
one wife is never invaded without poignant suffering.
A wealthy Mohammedan will establish each
of his wives in a separate house, those not able to
afford this luxury have their harem in one house.
It does not require a very vivid imagination to be
able to picture the inevitable result: jealousies, heartburnings,
contentions, wranglings, and worse.</p>

<p>A Bible woman told me of dreadful scenes where
the women fight like cats and dogs, and the husband
takes the part of the wife he loves the best and beats
the others. One feels that the man often bears his
own punishment for this state of things by being
obliged to live amid such scenes.</p>

<p>In a city of Northern Syria where the Mohammedans
are the most powerful class and their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>haughtiness and contempt of women so great that
they will elbow a foreign woman into the gutter,
not necessarily because she is a Christian, but because
she is a woman, a Syrian woman whispered
during a walk: "Look at that man over there, I'll
tell you about him later." And afterwards she explained
that the man was a neighbor and he had
just taken his fourth wife, and she was only ten
years old. He was an elderly man with gray hair.</p>

<p>One well-known and wealthy Mohammedan had
splendid establishments in four different places and
he is said to have had thirty sons. Another brought
home an English wife, with whom he had lived ten
years in England, and established her in an apartment
just above the one in which one of several
wives was living. Could English girls realize the
misery in store for them in marrying Mohammedan
husbands, they would be thankful for any warning.
Even if the husband himself is kind, there are many
painful things to undergo from his women relatives.
And worse than all is the denying of Christ before
men in the acceptance of Islam. One of these English
women living in Syria as the wife of a Mohammedan,
had her daughter married to an own cousin
at the age of thirteen, another was obliged to give
her ten-year-old daughter in marriage. I asked this
last woman how she could do such a thing. "It is
her father's will and I could do nothing." But she
ran away the next day, so the man divorced her.
This same daughter has been married and divorced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>twice since then, and is now living at home, and is
at the head of a Mohammedan school for girls.
Two other sisters have been divorced, and are at
home, one with her child.</p>

<p>In Beirut, among the better classes girls are not
married as young as they used to be, though occasionally
you hear of instances, as in the case of a
woman who had eight daughters and married two
of them, twins, at the age of eight. She gained
nothing by this cruel act as they were soon divorced
and sent home. One reason for child-marriages
among Mohammedans in Syria is the conscription
which demands for the army every young man of
eighteen. The one who cannot afford to escape
conscription by paid substitutes or money may be
exempt if he has a wife dependent upon him. When
he is sixteen or seventeen his family send off to some
distant town for a young girl who is a destitute
orphan, and this child is married to the youth,&mdash;she
may be ten years old, or nine, or even eight, and
cases are known where a girl of seven has been
married to a boy of sixteen.</p>

<p>One can hardly wonder that many of these girls
are divorced, for they are simply untrained, naughty
children, unable to grasp what the duties of a wife
are, or that it is necessary to please their husbands
or conciliate their mothers-in-law. Mohammedan
women say that the happiness of a child-wife and her
status in the family depend almost entirely upon
her mother-in-law. It is a sad fact that these little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>brides&mdash;children in years&mdash;are very often old in
knowledge of evil. Most Mohammedan children are
brought up in an atmosphere of such talk that their
natures seem steeped in vulgarity from their cradles
and no mystery of life or death is hidden from them.</p>

<p>It makes one's heart sick to think of these children,
so sinned against and so cruelly treated for
being the products of this system. Sad stories are
told of those who are put out to service, especially
when they go to Turkish families. It is not very
common, fortunately, for there is always the fear
that the men in the family, regarding them as lawful
prey, will ill-treat them. Girls disgraced in this
way have a terrible fate.</p>

<p>A friend came to us one day, weeping because of a
dreadful thing which had just come to her knowledge,
too late, alas! for any help to be given. The
daughter of a neighbor, a poor man, had been sent
out to service, and the worst befell her. She was
sent home in disgrace,&mdash;her father was obliged to
receive her, but he would not recognize her or have
anything to do with her till one day he ordered her
to go out into the garden and dig in a spot he indicated.
Each day he came to see what she had accomplished,
till at last there was a hole deep enough
for her to stand in, her full height. Her father then
called his brothers, they brought lime, poured it
over her, and then buried the child alive in the hole
she herself had dug. She was only twelve years
old! The neighbors found it out and informed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>government. The parents and all concerned were
imprisoned, and the father is still in prison, though
the mother has been released.</p>

<p>The feeling is strong that such a disgrace can
only be wiped out by death, and this is especially
the case when there has been misconduct between a
Mohammedan man and a Christian woman. In a
Syrian city a Christian girl of aristocratic family
was betrothed and was soon to be married when
suddenly the engagement was broken. It could no
longer be hidden that she had been guilty of wrong
relations with some man, and the man proved to
have been a Mohammedan. This disgrace was intolerable
to the families involved, and before long a
man connected with the family came to the girl with
a glass of liquid, and said: "Here, drink this!" She
took it, drank, and died. Comments on it showed
that the sentiment of the community is in sympathy
with such a course. "What else could be done?"
they say.</p>

<p>Probably a Mohammedan would not see the inconsistency
of condemning to death the child-victim
of a man's lust, as in the first instance given,
while practically the same thing is legalized in allowing
the marriage of children with the probability of
a divorce in the near future. How can they hope for
the growth of purity among their women, or wonder
when immorality and unchastity are discovered!</p>

<p>Frequent reference has been made to divorce. It
is the weapon always at hand when a man is dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>satisfied.
His law allows him to divorce his wife
twice and take her back, but if he divorce her the
third time, he may not take her back until she has
been married to another man and divorced by him.
The ceremony is a simple one; repeating a formula
three times in the presence of a witness not a member
of the household, and telling the wife to go to
her father.</p>

<p>A divorced wife must go back to her father's
house, or to her brother if her father is not living, or
to her nearest relative. If she is friendless then she
has the right to go before the Mejlis or Court, and
state her case. She is asked if she wishes to marry
again, and if so, the Court must find a husband for
her. If not, then the husband is made to support her.
If she returns to live with her friends, the husband
has to give her one penny halfpenny a day. If there
are children under seven they go with the mother.
If they are older, they are allowed to choose between
mother and father. They are supported by the
father.</p>

<p>The Mohammedans have a saying that when a
woman marries she is never sure that she will not be
returned, scorned and insulted, to her father's
house the next day; nor, when she prepares a meal
for her husband, is she sure that she will be his wife
long enough to eat of it herself.</p>

<p>In conversation with a Mohammedan woman one
day we were commenting on the fact that a certain
wealthy bridegroom had given directions to the pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>fessional
who was to adorn his bride for her marriage,
not to disfigure her face with the thick shining
paste which is usually considered (though very mistakenly)
to enhance her charms. He was reported
to have said that he wished to see her face as God
had made it. I remarked that I thought it was very
sensible and that I did not see what was ever gained
by disfiguring a face by plastering it with paint and
powders. The woman said: "But you do not understand!
We do it so that we may be beautiful in our
husband's eyes, for if we are pale or wrinkled they
cease to love us and go to other women or else they
divorce us." It is very far from being "for better,
for worse,&mdash;in sickness, in health."</p>

<p>It is impossible to gather statistics as to the proportionate
number of divorces. All the women say,
"It is very common." The condition of a divorced
woman returned to her father's house is not an
enviable one. In some cases they are kept on like
servants, living in some out-house or stable, or in
some inferior room if the house is a grand one. It
has been suggested by a writer, that the sight of the
misery of these positionless women has a strong influence
upon the young men of the family, making
them determine that they will never have more than
one wife. Let us hope that this is true. From what
is told me I have learned that it is not usually the
young men who have more than one wife, but the
older ones. I must not omit to say that in the
smaller Mohammedan settlements where there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>much intermarrying in families, there is almost no
divorce, for even if a man wishes it, he must be very
courageous to brave the united wrath of the whole
circle of female relatives or of his enraged uncle or
cousin, who resents bitterly having his daughter sent
back to her home.</p>

<p>Among the poorer people, too, those who have
come most closely under my observation, divorce is
rare and no man has more than one wife. But they
are steeped in superstition and many are so bigoted
they will not receive the visits of the Bible woman
nor allow their children to attend schools. Frequently,
in paying visits, we will find a blind Mohammedan
sheikh instructing the women in the
Koran, and some of them have very glib objections
to offer to the New Testament stories and truths
we read to them. They will often ask to be read to,
but the Old Testament is the favorite book.</p>

<p>Among the Druzes, divorce is even more common
than it is among the true Mohammedans, and the
state of morals is very low. The Druzes are an interesting,
even fascinating people. They live on the
Lebanons and inland on the Druze mountains of the
Hauran, and are a warlike independent race, of fine
physique, and most polished, courteous manners.
Some of their women are very beautiful and their
peculiar costumes are most becoming and picturesque.
They are always veiled, but one eye is
uncovered, and it is second nature with them to
draw their veils hastily across their faces if a man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>appears in sight. As was said before, they are
classed with the Mohammedans although they have
their own prophet, Hakim, and they take pride in
having their own secret religion, which is little more
than a brotherhood for political purposes. It is
extremely difficult to make any real impression on
them.</p>

<p>At a recent wedding in Druze high life in a
Lebanon village almost every woman present had
been divorced, and one woman was exactly like the
Samaritan woman who came to the well to draw
water: she had had five husbands, and the one she
had now was not her husband. The hostess herself,
the bridegroom's mother, a woman of fine presence,
had been divorced, but was brought back to
preside over this important function, as there was
no one else to do it, but her former husband was
not present, as Druze law forbids a man ever looking
again on the face of his divorced wife. Their
women are cast off in a most heartless way, but
they cannot be taken back again. The ceremony
of marriage consists in fastening up over a door a
sword wreathed with flowers and with candles tied
on it, and then passing under it.</p>

<p>The form of divorce is very simple. It is illustrated
in the life of a Druze prince who married a
girl of high family, beautiful and of a strong character
and fine mind. They were devoted to each
other, but she had no children. She had suspicions
of what was in store for her, which were realized one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>day when she had been on a visit to her native village
with her husband. They were riding together
towards home, when they came to a fork in the road.</p>

<p>The prince turned and said: "Here is the parting
of the way." She understood, and turned, weeping,
back to her father's house. The prince afterwards
sent and bought a beautiful Circassian slave, and
married her, but she had no children, and so she
in turn was divorced. The prince had, contrary to
custom, been in the habit of paying visits to the
house of his first wife who had been married to
another man, and now he obliged her second husband
to divorce her. He turned Mohammedan in
order to be able to take his wife back again.</p>

<p>Among the Druzes, the ladies of good family are
secluded even more rigorously than in Mohammedan
families. Even in the villages they rarely
leave their homes, going out only at night to pay
visits to women of equal station. Some of them
have never been outside of their own doors since
they were little girls. One girl, the daughter of an
Emir, was sent away to spend a year in a Protestant
boarding-school. There she was allowed to go for
walks with the girls, attended the church services,
and had a glimpse into a life very different from the
dull seclusion which would naturally be her lot
among her own people. But she failed to take home
the lessons taught her that Christ was her Saviour
and Friend, and would be her help and comfort in
whatever was hard to bear. She returned to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>home and soon learned that, although she had been
allowed these unusual privileges, she need expect
no more liberty than her mother had been allowed
before her. She found the shut-in life so intolerable
that she secretly ate the heads of matches and
poisoned herself so that she sickened and died, having
confessed her act and telling the reason.</p>

<p>There are others among these girls who have been
taught in evangelical schools, who have learned to
love Christ, whose faith is strong and whose trust
sustains them and keeps them patient and cheerful
amid very great trials and even cruel treatment from
their husbands, "Strengthened in their endurance by
the vision of the Invisible God."</p>

<p>To go back to Mohammedan women. It is surprising
how exceedingly ignorant many of them are,
even the women of the higher classes from whom
you might expect better things. A visitor inquired
of her Mohammedan hostess if she would tell her the
name of the current Mohammedan month. "I do
not concern myself with such things, you must ask
the Effendi." Their minds seem to be blank except
in regard to their relations to their families, to sleeping,
eating, and diseases, to their clothes, and their
servants, and the current gossip of the neighborhood.
Formerly it was not believed that girls were
capable of learning anything, and years ago an
Effendi in Tripoli, when urged to have his daughter
taught to read, exclaimed, "Teach a girl to read!
I should as soon try to teach a cat!" But those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>days are passing and the Mohammedans are beginning
to bestir themselves in the matter of educating
their girls. They are opening schools for girls in
all the cities, though judging from the attainments
of some of the teachers, the girls are not taught
very much. When these schools were first opened
in Beirut, the only available teachers were girls who
had been in attendance on the Protestant schools,
and some of them had only been there a few months.</p>

<p>In Sidon there is a large Mohammedan school
for girls, where are gathered from five to six hundred
girls. The Koran is the text-book, reading and
writing are taught and needle-work has a large place
in the curriculum.</p>

<p>Years ago an old Effendi was attending the examination
in Miss Taylor's school for Mohammedan
and Druze girls. "My two granddaughters are
here," he said to a missionary sitting beside him. "I
was instrumental in starting a school of our own
for girls, and I took my granddaughters away from
here and put them in the new school. One day I
went to visit the school. When I was still at a distance
I heard the teacher screaming at the girls and
cursing them, saying, 'May God curse the beard of
your grandfathers, you dogs!' Now, I was the
grandfather of two of those children and I knew
they heard enough of such language at home without
being taught it at school, so I brought them
back to this good place."</p>

<p>The aim of the Mohammedans in their schools is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>twofold: being both to benefit and train the girls,
making them more companionable, and also to
fortify them against Christian teaching. The aim
of our work and our teaching is more than that, for
we desire, not only to enlarge the mental horizon
but to cultivate the heart, to open up for them the
wellspring of true joy and store their memories with
hymns of praise and the inspiring and comforting
words of Christ. But more than all to lead them to
accept for themselves their only Saviour, the Son of
God, who died for them, who only is the true
"Prophet of the Highest," whose mission is "to
give light to them that sit in darkness and in the
shadow of death." We claim for these dear women
and girls the liberty which their own sacred Koran
inculcates: "Let there be no compulsion in religion."
(From the Sura called "The Cow," v. 257.)</p>

<p>And will the favored Christian women of England,
America, and Germany, and all free Christian
lands not join those already on the field either in
prayer or personal service, that they may have a
part in bringing many of these Mohammedan
women, sweet and lovable, and capable of rising to
high levels as many of them are, out of their "darkness
into His Marvellous Light"?</p>

<h2>BEHIND THE LATTICE IN TURKEY</h2>


<p>If the condition of women under Islam is degraded
and wellnigh hopeless in other parts of the
world, what must be the condition of such women in
Turkey, the seat of Moslem power, the centre of
the Caliphate, with the green flag of the Prophet
kept at Seraglio Point, in Constantinople?</p>

<p>The picture of woman's degradation throughout
the Empire is black enough, yet gleams of light
play over the blackness, and these gleams grow
steadily stronger and more frequent. Turkey not
only borders upon Europe, and thus is nearer to
Western civilization and its progress, but its extended
coast-line affords many ports of entry, to
which comes no inconsiderable part of the travel
and trade of the world. Kaiser William's railroads
are opening up the western portion of the empire,
and cause a curious jumble of modern advance with
so-called fixed Oriental ways.</p>

<p>With their parasols held low over their heads,
even though the day be cloudy, or the sun be set, the
veiled and costumed Turkish women may be seen
in crowds on Friday, their Sabbath, and holidays,
sitting upon grassy slopes, with their children play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>ing
about them. They go in groups or followed by
a servant, if from richer families, as they are not
trusted to go alone. In the interior, even, non-Moslem
women are veiled almost as closely as the
Mohammedans, when upon the street. Such is the
power of prejudice that it is not thought proper for
any woman to be seen in public.</p>

<p>They live behind their lattices, and woe to any
Christian house whose windows command a view
into a Moslem neighbor's premises, no matter how
distant. Such juxtaposition is the reason for the
unsightly walls and lofty screens which disfigure
many an otherwise beautiful view, in any part of
Turkey. No strange man may look upon any Moslem
woman.</p>

<p>The slow but sure disintegration of these customs,
prejudices, and superstitions, is going on, thank God!
Darkness is fleeing before the light. If the churches
of Christ will but take the watchword, "The Moslem
world for Christ, in this century!" and put all
needed resources of men and means, consecrated
energy and prayer, into the campaign, even the
False Prophet shall be vanquished before Him who
is King of kings and Lord of lords!</p>

<p>I have travelled on the railroad in Turkey with
Moslem women, in the special compartment, where
in the freedom of the day's travel, they have thrown
back their veils and silken wraps, showing their
pretty French costumes and the diamonds upon
their fingers, as they offered their Frank fellow-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>traveller
cake, or possibly chocolates, and have more
than once felt the embarrassment of a missionary
purse too slender to allow of such luxuries, with
which to return the compliment. Once a Moslem
woman took from her travelling hand-basket paper
and pencil, and proceeded to write, as I was doing!
Page after page she wrote, though in just the reverse
manner from our writing, and we soon established
a feeling of comradeship.</p>

<p>I have been also a deeply sympathetic witness of
moving scenes in which the proverbial love of the
Turkish father for his children could not be concealed.
As the train awaited the signal for departure
from a station, one day, the evident distress of
a pretty girl opposite me, broke into crying. She
had climbed into the corner by the window, and the
guard had not yet closed the door. Involuntarily
my eyes followed the child's grieved gaze, until
they rested upon a tall, gray-bearded Turkish officer
standing by the station, who was evidently striving
to control his emotion answering to the grief of
the child. Finally he yielded to the heart-broken
crying of the little one, and came to the car door
to speak soothingly to her. The young mother
sat stoically through it all, seemingly content with
her rich dress and jewels, and her comfortable appointments
for travelling. Not so with the father
and his child, who were so grieved over their coming
separation. When finally the door had been
slammed by the guard, and locked, and our journey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>begun, some time elapsed before the still grieving
child could be won to take any interest in the good
things with which her mother then sought to beguile
her. Surely such a human father, so tender toward
his little child, could be taught the love of our
Heavenly Father for each child of His, which has
provided a Saviour for every repenting soul returning
to Him! Thus the lion would be changed into
the lamb, and the Turkish officer, often unspeakably
cruel to his enemies, would become a man and a
brother even to his foes.</p>

<p>Moslem women, although by the rules of their
religion almost entirely secluded from the outer
world, and from all men save those of their own
families, are, nevertheless, being powerfully affected
by the growing light of civilization, which has not
only revealed their darkness, but has penetrated
it to some degree, while the burning glow and
love of Christianity, through zenana workers and
schools, has far more than begun the work of
transformation.</p>

<p>How can mothers consent that their daughters
shall be sold, while yet children, to any man, no
matter how old, who will pay the price her father
demands for her, when she has learned even a little
of the loving honor given to his wife and daughter
by the Christian husband and father? How can she
consent to see her given in a marriage to which her
approval has not even been asked, or possibly where
it has been refused? Yet, pity it is that without the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>consent of mother or girl, she may be conveyed, a
bride, to the house of her lord, who has perhaps
not deigned to be present,&mdash;and she of course not,&mdash;at
the arrangement by their legal representatives,
for signing the contract, and fixing the amount of
dowry which she brings, or the sum which he shall
give her in case he at any time shall decree her
divorce. This is all that constitutes the marriage
ceremony in Turkey. I once saw the arrival of a
Turkish bride at her bridegroom's house. There
was no welcome. She alighted with a woman
friend from the closed carriage. Some one must
have waited within the garden, for the heavy street-gate
opened at their approach, received the women,
closed upon them, and the bride was shut into her
husband's house, from all the world. If she displeases
him in any way, even if her cooking does
not suit him, a word from her husband suffices to
divorce a wife, according to Moslem law. He may
have as many wives as he wishes, and another is
easily found.</p>

<p>Mohammedan husbands are allowed to punish
their wives with blows, to enforce obedience. A
whole town pervaded by these Turkish ideas was
filled with amazement at a burly non-Moslem friend
of mine, whose wife had become a Christian. Although
jeered at and ridiculed by his companions
as one who could not make his wife obey him, he
never lifted his hand against her, for he loved her
too well. He did, however, cause her great unhap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>piness
for years, until the Spirit of God broke his
hard heart, and made him also a Christian.</p>

<p>No Turk expects a woman to speak to him in a
public place, or if she does he will not raise his eyes
from the ground. A friend of mine was in deepest
distress in a lonely place in Turkey, wringing
her hands and crying "Alas! Alas!" as she saw a
man approaching her; but Agha Effendim gave her
no heed until she walked straight up to him, so sore
was her need, and told him her trouble. Then his
heart was touched, and Mohammedan Albanian as
he was, he rendered her the aid which she
asked.</p>

<p>Forty Mohammedan women, living too distant
from Mecca to allow a pilgrimage thither, made
the ascent, one summer, of one of the loftiest mountain
peaks in European Turkey. They did this as a
religious duty. It was a feat which required all the
vigor and strength of an American mountain-climber,
who ascended the same peak some days
later. She could not abandon the task, however,
which they had accomplished, whose feet knew only
the heelless slipper or the wooden clog, when about
their household duties, or stepped noiselessly in their
gaily embroidered homemade stockings, when indoors.
<i>The Turkish woman can climb.</i> She can
reach lofty heights. Slowly and painfully she will
leave her dense ignorance, her habits of superstition,
her jealousies, and her intrigues behind her
and will emerge, led by the loving hand of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>Christian sister, sometimes of her husband or child,
into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</p>

<p>We admit that ofttimes the obstacles seem insuperable,
when we meet the barrier of the unawakened
life. What opportunity is there before
the little mother but fourteen years old herself?
How shall she escape the name which her own
family perhaps give her&mdash;"a cow"? "Cattle" is a
common term for women. Her men-folks will
very likely hinder her education, in many instances,
but she must be led out of her old life, along this
way. The mothers of coming generations, with
unlimited influence over their husband's inclination
and conduct even when set toward progress&mdash;the
Turkish woman <i>must</i> be reached! Christianity is
the one means to allay her superstitions, her jealousies,
her fears, and to give her a true outlook upon
life and its meaning. The women of Christendom
must help her who cannot help herself. The pitifulness
of the condition of Turkish women, and
the difficulty of reaching them, form the challenge
of Islam to the Christian world. Shall we take up
the gauntlet thrown down by the Crescent and the
Star, and lifting high the banner of the Cross, go
forward in Christ's name, because God wills their
salvation as truly as ours, and sends us to them in
His name?</p>

<p>The influence of civilization is necessarily felt
far less in the interior of Turkey than in the maritime
sections; yet here also, thanks to the multipli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>cation
of schools and teachers and loving Christian
women trained in those schools, conditions are beginning
to be changed. "In one city of western
Turkey," we are told, "the Turks themselves asked
for a kindergarten teacher from our American mission
school, to open a kindergarten for them, and it
was done. Girls' schools have sprung up among the
Moslems in various parts of the country, from the
same influences which affected Greeks and Armenians,
though more slowly. Quite recently there
has been an awakening among the Turks to the fact
that if they would keep pace with the march of civilization
they must provide for the education of their
girls. So now, in some of the large cities, schools
for Turkish girls have been established, and, although
the attendance is still small and the work
elementary, yet it shows the trend of opinion, and
gives great hope of soon bettering the condition of
women in the empire."</p>

<p>Another observer writes concerning more progressive
portions of Turkey: "The power of education
is proving a sure disintegrator to the seclusion
of Moslem social life. Turkish women have already
taken enviable places among the writers of their
nation. Others are musicians, physicians, nurses,
and a constantly increasing number are availing
themselves of the educational facilities afforded by
the German, French, and other foreign institutions
which have been established at Constantinople,
Smyrna, and elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>In the beautiful American College for Girls, on the
heights of Scutari, Constantinople, Turkish girls,
as well as those of all nationalities of the Orient
and Franks, eagerly take advantage of the course,
and a few have graduated with honor. A far larger
number, however, are removed to the seclusion of
their homes as they approach maidenhood. On the
day when the first six girls from Moslem families
were received, more than one of them learned the
entire English alphabet. What a need for prayer
that the Spirit of God shall reach those receptive
young hearts from the very first day, in this and
every other Christian educational institution to
which Moslem girls turn their steps!" The most
tactful and consecrated work of their missionary or
native teachers must be done every day, for such
Turkish girls, whether in more elementary schools
or in colleges, inasmuch as the proverb of the country:
"Either marry your daughter at sixteen or bury
her!" is still very much in force beyond those limited
districts where the influence of Western ideas
has availed to modify somewhat the old thought.
What they gain during the short time when they
may remain in school, must be the food of their
lives, in multitudes of instances.</p>

<p>We know the paucity of literature of all kinds in
Turkey, where government press regulations prohibit
any general output of publications; this, combined
with the very general poverty of the people,
makes many a home bookless, and the great major<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>ity
of lives barren. Sometimes in missionary tours
we have seen far up on the hillside a group of poor
peasants descending. The sudden turning of the
women of that party, drawing their filthy veils
closer across their faces on hot July or August days,
reveals to the passers-by that these are Moslems.
They have discovered that there are men in the approaching
party of travellers. They may have mistaken
the ladies wearing hats as gentlemen also. A
command has evidently been given by their lord and
master, at which the women have sunk to the ground,
with their backs to the road, while still far from it,
lest one of those infidel eyes should peer through
their veils, and look upon their faces. Yet women's
curiosity compels those hidden eyes to seek at least
a surreptitious peep at the foreign travellers, and
they watch us furtively. Under such circumstances
there can be no hope of any personal touch, save if
occasion might arise which would allow a call at the
hovel which constitutes their home. On one of my
last journeys in Turkey I chanced to meet a Turkish
soldier on a lonely mountain road. As I passed
him, walking in advance of my horse and driver,
filled with no small trepidation at such proximity in
that lonely place, he gave me no salutation, and I
confess to a feeling of relief when I had passed him
unchallenged. But how that feeling changed to
remorse when my driver overtook me, and said that
the soldier had stopped him to inquire if the teacher
who had just gone by were a doctor, for a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>child of his lay at home grievously ill. What an
opportunity had been missed! If he only had
spoken, the pitiful need in that home would have
been opened up to the missionary teacher, who, although
not a doctor, would have done what she
could to relieve the little sufferer, and to comfort
the sorrowing parents. There would have been a
chance to bring to that poor, ignorant mother in her
miserable home, a token of love and tenderness out
of the great world of which she knew nothing.</p>

<p>One of the most discouraging aspects of life in
Turkey at the present time, is found in the fact that
as men travel about in their business or professional
life; come into contact in various ways with those
of different views and more advanced thought than
themselves; become influenced by them; and mildly
enthusiastic to put the new ideas into practice; they
are met on the very threshold of their homes by
their uncomprehending and immovable wives, who
with horror refuse to allow the souls of their
families to be imperilled by tolerating any such
heresies. This difficulty, instead of being cause for
discouragement, constitutes a powerful challenge to
the heart of Christianity, to help such an awakening
man, and to find the dormant soul of this
woman. No opposition can long stand before the
appeal of the Gospel, when tactfully, lovingly, prayerfully
brought to bear upon such souls.</p>

<p>Fatima Khanum ("my Sovereign Fatima"), a
Bible woman, seventy years old, finds the joy of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>Lord to be still her strength, as she goes from house
to house, telling in her musical Turkish tongue the
story of God's love for every man, and urges all to
receive it. Very closely they get together on a
wintry day, as visitor and visited gather about the
brazier of coals, and talk over the wonderful words
of life. May God greatly multiply the number of
such faithful witnesses for Him, throughout the
Turkish Empire!</p>

<p>"Evet, Effendim!" ("yes, my lord!") frequently
says a missionary friend who, having learned the
Turkish as her missionary language when a young
teacher, still cherishes her love for it, and sometimes
uses it to her best-beloved. Shall we not say, Yes,
Lord! to Him who died on Calvary for all, and who
is "not willing that any should perish," and with
Him seek those "other sheep," and bring them to
the fold of the Good Shepherd? There can be no
failure here, although the church of Christ has but
slowly and late come to the realization that the
Mohammedan world too, with its millions of women
and children, must be His. Hath not God said:
"Look unto Me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the
earth: for I am God, and there is none else....
Unto Me every knee shall bow"?</p>

<h2>A VOICE FROM BULGARIA</h2>


<p>I received some days ago your letter asking for
something upon the condition of Mohammedan
women in Bulgaria. My observation has been limited,
and I have not had opportunity to learn from
others what they had seen, except from our dear old
Fatima Hanum, for so many years a Bible woman
among Mohammedan women.</p>

<p>Bulgaria cannot be called Turkey. Indeed it is
much freer from Turkish influence than Egypt is.
There is a free intercourse also between Turkish,
Bulgarian, and Armenian women, which must influence
the home life and the views of the Mohammedan
families. Most of them would be ashamed
to take more than one woman, and the Turkish
women are continually comparing their situation
and life with that of their Christian neighbors.
They are sad not to be able to read and write, and
they try to give their daughters a better education.
But as they see that their (orthodox) Bulgarian
neighbors care more for instruction than for religion
and real education, they, of course, cannot understand
till now, that religion is the root of culture.</p>

<p>Polygamy is by no means prevalent among the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>Mohammedans of Bulgaria, indeed it is very rare
that a man has more than one wife, but these few
exceptions are productive of great misery. Divorce
for very trivial reasons is not uncommon, but there
has recently occurred under my eye a case of happy
reconciliation and restoration through the influence
of Christian friends.</p>

<p>The Mohammedan woman of Bulgaria shares to
a degree the freedom of her Bulgarian sisters, is a
power in the home, and, especially if the mother
of grown sons, is much respected and considered.
But ignorance is her curse. Here and there one
finds a grown woman able to read, but the mass
are content to let their girls go to school for a few
years and then gradually forget all they have
learned. But still I have known some keenly interested
in the reading of Scripture. I recall one visit
in a roomful of women at the festival of Bairam,
when a young girl attracted by the Injil Sherif&mdash;the
New Testament&mdash;in the hands of the Bible woman,
opened it and read aloud the whole of the eighteenth
chapter of Luke to that roomful of deeply interested
listeners. As she finished, clasping the book to her
heart, she exclaimed: "Oh, give me this wonderful
book, I must read it all." When we left she followed
me to the door, reminding us earnestly of our
promise to send her a book soon. We know that the
book was much read.</p>

<p>Another girl of seventeen, whom Fatima Hanum
had taught not only to read but to love the Book,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>found great comfort in the prayers and Christian
sympathy of this same dear friend during a long
illness. On her death-bed she said to her mother:
"We have lived in darkness, but there is light and I
have seen it!"</p>

<p>We believe the light is beginning to glimmer in
more than one Mohammedan home in Bulgaria. In
this city, as in many others, Mohammedan women
are accustomed to spend Friday, whenever the
weather will permit, under the trees in some pleasant
spot, and Fatima Hanum with her Bible is
a familiar figure among them&mdash;indeed they often
send word to her: "We are going out for the day.
Come with us and bring the Book."</p>

<p>In a recent tour I was a welcome guest in several
Turkish homes, and warm approval was expressed
by the women of their Protestant neighbors&mdash;only
one failing was regretted&mdash;"they eat pork," but
even they acknowledged that it wasn't so bad as telling
lies, and saying unkind things about each other;
and they begged me to come again and read to them
from our Great Teacher's Book.</p>

<h2><a name="XVII" id="XVII"></a>XVII</h2>

<h2>DARKNESS AND DAYBREAK IN PERSIA</h2>


<p>One can never forget the first sight of a Moslem
woman&mdash;that veiled figure, moving silently through
the streets, so enshrouded that face and form are
completely concealed. Men and women pass each
other with no greeting or token of recognition, and
if a wife accompanies her husband, she never walks
beside him, but at a respectful distance behind, and
neither gives a sign that they belong together.</p>

<p>A woman's first instinct is to efface herself. Even
the poor, washing clothes in the street at the water-course,
pull their tattered rags over their faces. The
Persian expression for women, "those who sit behind
the curtain," shows that their place is silence
and seclusion. When the closed carriage of a princess
passes, her servants, galloping before, order all men
to turn their faces to the wall, though all they could
possibly see would be carefully veiled figures. The
beggar sitting on the ground at the street corner is
equally invisible under her cotton <i>chader</i>, as with
lamentable voice she calls for mercy on the baby in
her arms.</p>

<p>During the month of mourning, we often pass a
brilliantly lighted mosque, where men sit sipping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>tea or smoking, listening to the tale of the death of
their martyrs, but crouching on the stony street outside
in the darkness, a crowd of women are straining
their ears to catch what they can. Such are
the passing glimpses one gets of the Persian woman
in public.</p>

<p>Her real life is lived in the "harem." We realize
its meaning, "the forbidden," when after passing
through the imposing street gate, and the outer
court where are the men's apartments, we are conducted
to a curtained door, guarded by a sentinel,
who summons an old eunuch to lead us through a
dark, narrow passage into the inner court, or
<i>andaroon</i>. Here no man may enter but the very
nearest relatives of the inmates, and they under
severe restrictions. As women, we have free access,
and this privilege is shared by the Christian
physician, who is welcomed and trusted. One such
gives us this picture.</p>

<p>The <i>andaroon</i> is usually very far from being an
abode of luxury, even in wealthy families, unless
the number of wives is limited to one or two. The
favorite wife has many advantages over her rivals,
but she is usually encouraged to set an example of
severe simplicity, in respect to her house and its furnishings,
to the other wives; each of whom would
make life a burden to her lord, were marked discrimination
shown in such things. He, therefore,
contents himself with reserving the best of everything
for the <i>beroon</i>, or outer apartments, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>he receives his own guests. Here are fountains,
spacious courts, shady walks, and profusion of
flowers without, while within are large, high-ceiled
and stuccoed rooms, elaborate windows, delicately
wrought frescoes, the finest rugs and divans, showy
chandeliers and candelabra, stately pier glasses
brought on camels' backs from distant Trebizond
or Bushire, inlaid tables from Shiraz, and portières
from Reshd.</p>

<p>The <i>andaroon</i> presents a marked contrast. The
rooms are usually small and low without ventilation,
the courts confined, sunless, and bare; the garden ill-kept,
and the general air of a backyard pervading
the entire establishment. This order is reversed by
many ecclesiastics, who in deference to the popular
idea, that to be very holy, one must be very dirty,
reserve all their luxuries for the <i>andaroon</i>, and
make a show of beggarly plainness in the part of
the house to which their pupils and the public have
access.</p>

<p>The Persian wife seldom ventures into the
<i>beroon</i>, and when she does, it is as an outsider
only, who is tolerated as long as no other visitor
is present. All its belongings are in charge of men-servants,
and the dainty touches of the feminine
hand are nowhere seen in their arrangement, and
her presence is lacking there, to greet its guests, or
grace its entertainments.</p>

<p>When the Khanum suffers from any of the ailments,
for which in America or Europe outdoor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>exercise, travel, a visit to the seaside, to the mountains,
or to the baths is required, the physician feels
his helplessness. He sees that the patient cannot
recover her nervous tone in her present environment.
But there is no seaside except at impossible
distances and in impossible climates. A visit to the
mountains would mean being shut up in a little dirty
village, whose houses are mud hovels, the chief industry
of whose women is the milking of goats
and sheep, and working up beds of manure with
bare feet, and moulding it by hand into cakes for
fuel. Or, if the husband have both the means and
the inclination, for her sake to make an encampment
upon the mountains large enough to afford security
from robbers and wandering tribes, she would be
confined largely to the precincts inclosed by the canvas
wall surrounding the harem. She rides only in
a <i>kajava</i>, or basket, or in a closed <i>takhterawan</i>,
or horse litter, or, as she sits perched high up,
astride a man's saddle, looking in her balloon garments,
and doubtless feeling, more insecure than
Humpty Dumpty on the wall. In her outdoor
costume, the Khanum never walks. At best she can
only waddle, therefore she is almost as effectually
shut out from this important form of exercise as
the women of China. In both countries the peasant
class are blessed with more freedom than those of
higher rank, and the village women, dispensing with
the baggy trousers and in some districts also with
the <i>chader</i>, or mantle, swing by on the road with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>an elastic stride that would do credit to a veteran
of many campaigns.</p>

<p>Travelling in Persia is, for women particularly,
a matter of so great discomfort, that even the shortest
journey could seldom be recommended as a
health measure. There are some famous mineral
springs in Northern Persia, but they are usually in
regions difficult of access, and often dangerous on
account of nomads and robbers, and they generally
have only such facilities for bathing as nature has
afforded. If they really do heal diseases their virtues
must be marvellous, for the sick who visit them
usually stay but a day or two, though they make
a business of bathing while they have the opportunity.
To prescribe travel, therefore, would be about
the equivalent of prescribing a journey to the moon,
and to recommend outdoor exercise for an inmate
of the <i>andaroon</i> would be like prescribing a daily
exercise in flying, the one being about as practicable
as the other. Should the physician find it necessary
on the other hand to isolate his patient for the treatment
of hysteria, which is exceedingly common, or
for mental troubles, which are also very common, he
is equally at sea. No nurse, not even a "Sairey
Gamp" could be found. When it is known that one
has a severe illness or visitation from God, they
come, as in the days of Job, "every one from his own
place&mdash;to mourn with him."</p>

<p>In cases where absolute isolation has been ordered,
as an essential condition of the patient's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>recovery, the physician may expect on his next
visit to find the room filled with chattering women,
who have gathered to speculate on the possibilities
of a recovery or each to recommend the decoction
which cured some one else, whose case was "just like
this." There is but little watching done at night
in the most severe cases, and a physician is seldom
called up at night to see a patient.</p>

<p>On my first introduction to the <i>andaroon</i>, I had
little acquaintance with either Persian customs or
costumes. I had been asked to see the wife of a high
dignitary, and on my arrival was at once ushered
into her presence. I found my fair patient awaiting
me, standing beside a fountain, in the midst
of a garden quite Oriental in its features. She was
closely veiled, but her feet and legs were bare, and
her skirts were so economically abbreviated as at
first to raise the question in my mind, whether I
had not by mistake of the servant been announced
before the lady had completed her toilet. She, however,
held out her hand, which apparently she did
not intend me to shake, and I presently made out
that I was expected to feel her pulse as the preliminary
to my inquiries concerning her symptoms; or
rather in lieu of them, the competent Persian physician
needing no other clue to the diagnosis. Then
the pulse of the other wrist had to be examined, and
I inspected the tongue, of which I obtained a
glimpse between the skilfully disposed folds of the
veil. This woman had been suffering from a ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>larial
disease, which had manifested some grave
symptoms, and I tried to impress upon the family
the importance of her taking prompt measures to
avert another paroxysm. Feeling somewhat anxious
as to the result, I sent the next morning to
inquire about her condition and the effect of the
remedy prescribed, but learned to my disgust that
the medicine had not yet been given, the Mullah who
must make "istekhara" (cast the lot) to ascertain
whether the remedy was a suitable one for the
case, not having yet arrived.</p>

<p>Seclusion, lack of exercise, the monotony that
leaves the mind to prey upon itself, ignorance, early
marriage, unhappiness, abuse, and contagious diseases
bring upon the Persian woman a great amount
of physical suffering directly traceable to the system
of Mohammedanism. One special demand of her
religion, the month of fasting, is a case in point.
At the age of seven, the girls must assume this burden,
not taken up by boys till they are thirteen. For
a mere child to be deprived of food and drink,
sometimes for seventeen hours at a stretch, day
after day, and then allowed to gorge herself at
night, cannot but be a physical injury.</p>

<p>In illness, no pen can depict the contrast between
a refined Christian sickroom and the crowded noisy
apartment, poisoned with tobacco smoke, where lies
the poor Persian woman in the dirty garments of
every-day wear, covered by bedding in worse condition.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>
<p>Mentally, the Persian women are as bright as
those of any race. The same physician says, "The
Persian woman is often neither a doll nor a drudge.
I have known some who were recipients of apparently
true love, respect, and solicitude on the part
of their husbands, as their sisters in Christian lands;
some who were very entertaining in conversation,
even in their husbands' presence; some who were
their husbands' trusted counsellors; some who were
noted for learning; some who were successfully
managing large estates; some who have stood by me
in my professional work, in emergencies demanding
great strength of character and freedom from race
and sectarian prejudice."</p>

<p>But these are the exceptions; scarcely one in a
thousand has any education, even in its most restricted
sense of being able to read and write her
own language intelligently. It is marvellous to see
how all the advantages are lavished on the boy,
who will have Arabic, Persian, and French tutors,
while his sister is taught nothing. In consequence,
the ignorance and stupidity of woman have become
proverbial. It is a common saying, "Her hair is
long, but her wit is short."</p>

<p>In a Persian newspaper, there lately appeared
some articles in which, after apologizing for mentioning
the subject of women, the writer spoke
strongly of their present illiterate state. He taxed
the mothers with the great mortality among children,
and made the amazing statement, that in Australia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>every woman who loses a child is punished by law
with the loss of a finger! He did not venture to
prescribe this drastic remedy for Persia, but says
the husbands and fathers who allow their women to
remain in ignorance should be held up to public
scorn and contempt, and that nothing but education
and religion will make a change.</p>

<p>Wonderful to relate, this article elicited the following
reply from a lady, which we print as it was
written:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<h3>LETTER FROM A MOSLEM WOMAN</h3>


<p><i>To the honored and exalted editor of the "Guide":</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>"I myself have no education, but my two children,
a boy and a girl, have a little. Every day
they use your paper for their reading lesson, and I
listen with the greatest attention. Truly, as far as
a patriot's duty goes, you are discharging it. Your
paper is having a remarkable effect on the minds of
both men and women. I rejoice, and am delighted
with your love for race and country, and praise
especially the articles recommending the education
of women.</p>

<p>"Some days ago, the children were reading, and I
was listening because I take such an interest in the
writings in the <i>Guide</i> that I am constrained to defer
the most necessary labors, till the reading is finished.
You have spoken well about the poor unfortunate
women; but first the men must be educated; because
the girl receives instruction from her father and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>the wife from her husband. You reproach these
ill-starred women, because they are addicted to
superstitious practices. Your humble servant makes
a petition that they are not so much to blame.</p>

<p>"In this very city I know men of the first rank,
who have even travelled in Europe (I will not mention
their names) who are superstitious to an incredible
degree. Before putting on a new suit of
clothes, they consult the astrologer and look in the
calendar for an auspicious hour, and if shoes or
other articles come from the bazaar at an unlucky
moment, they return them till the stars shall be
more propitious; when they contemplate a visit to
royalty, or to Government officials, they take the
chaplet of beads and cast lots to ascertain a fortunate
time. Is it then strange that women believe in
written prayers, fortune telling, and the <i>istekhara</i>?
You write that in a foreign country you have seen
men who had fled there to escape their wives. You
are telling the truth, because, indeed, the women are
a thousand times more incapable than the men. And
why should they not be, who always sit behind a
curtain wrapped in a veil? The husband can flee
from his wife to a foreign land, but what of her
who is left behind: her arms are, as it were, broken,
her condition remediless, hopeless? For her, there
is but one place whither she may flee&mdash;the grave!
Look, and you will see in every cemetery one-fourth
of all are men's graves; the rest are of women who
have escaped their husbands by death.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
<p>"Again you speak of their ignorance of domestic
economy, the rearing of children, the avoidance of
contagious diseases, etc. When a poor woman is
taken to her husband's home, it is true she knows
nothing of these things, and does not make home
comfortable, but by the time she is the mother of
two or three children, she begins to learn; she economizes
in food and clothing; she looks after her
children; she adds to her husband's prosperity. She
takes a pride in the home, in which she hopes to
enjoy many happy days; but poor creature! she
sees one day a woman entering her door, who says,
'Your husband has married me,' She recalls all
her struggles for family and home, and her heart
is filled with bitterness. Quarrels ensue, and her
husband, taking a stick, beats her till she is like
well-kneaded dough. Afterwards they both go before
the judge, who without making any investigation
of the case, gives sentence in favor of the man.
'You have not in any wise transgressed the law;
the female tribe are all radically bad; if this one
says anything more, punish her.' Unfortunate
creature! If she is modest and self-respecting, this
trouble falling upon her occasions various illnesses,
and she knows not what becomes of house and children.
The neighbor women, seeing all this, are completely
discouraged from improving their homes,
or rearing their children properly, as they say,
'The more our husbands' circumstances improve,
the less they will care for us.' Why then reproach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>the women? It is proper to advise the men, who
have learned two things thoroughly from the law of
the Prophet: one I have mentioned, and the other is
this. In the evening when the Aga comes, he first
washes himself to be ceremonially clean and says
his prayers to fulfill the law of the prophet. Then
he goes to his private room, or to the men's
apartments. Half an hour does not pass, till he
sends to demand the <i>ajil</i> (food used with intoxicating
drinks, meat, fruits, etc.). The wife makes
all ready, and sends to him. Then the unhappy soul
hears from that quarter the sound of piano, organ,
or tambourine, and some women just from their feelings
at such times, become a prey to divers maladies
and untold misery. At one or two o'clock in the
morning, the Aga brings his honorable presence into
the <i>andaroon</i>. The wife asks, 'What is this business
in which you have been engaged? How long
must I put up with these evil doings?' Immediately
a quarrel ensues; the husband, partially or quite intoxicated,
and not in his right mind, answers,
'What business of yours is it what I do? If I wish
to bring the musicians and dancing women, I shall
do as I like.' Many women, on account of these
evil practices of their husbands, give themselves up
also to wicked ways, and others take to their beds
with grief. Should such a one take her case to a
judge, he is worse than her husband, and should she
complain to the religious heads, many of them in
secret indulge in the same vices.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
<p>"Why then judge so severely those who are all
suffering under these troubles? Again you say that
women should be educated, but fail to indicate in
which quarter of our city is situated the school
which they are to attend. We, in our ignorance
of its location, beg you to point out where we may
find it. In my own neighborhood there are twenty
capable girls who are ready; some wishing to study
dressmaking, some sick-nursing, midwifery, etc.
Unfortunately, our nobles and ecclesiastics are so
busy, advancing the price of wheat, speculating on
the next harvest, snatching their neighbors' caps
from their heads, that they have not yet found
time to establish a school or university. I hope,
through a blessing on the labors of your pen, this
will all be remedied, and this stupid people awaken
from its sleep. This brief petition I have made,
and my daughter has written it out. As I have no
learning, I beg you to excuse its mistakes and
defects." ...</p></div>

<p>This letter is remarkable as showing that an
awakening is beginning in this country and that
some women are feeling its influence; that among
them there are stirrings of a new ambition, and a
great dissatisfaction with their present condition.
Moslem ladies, invited to witness the closing exhibition
of a school for missionary children, exclaimed,
"When will our daughters have such opportunities?"
A young girl was filled with the extraordi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>nary
ambition to become a doctor, like the lady
physician whom she admired; she came for lessons
in English, physiology, chemistry, and materia
medica, showing talent and remarkable studiousness;
but during a disturbance against foreign
schools, her father forbade her coming, so the cloud
again shrouded this particular bright star.</p>

<p>What is the legal and social position of woman?
A girl comes into the world unwelcome; while the
birth of a boy is announced and celebrated with
great rejoicings, that of his sister is regarded as a
misfortune. Said a mother, "Why should I not
weep over my baby girl, who must endure the same
sorrows I have known? She is of little value; a
father of passionate temper, annoyed by the crying
of the sickly infant daughter, flung her out of the
window, effectually and forever stilling the pitiful
wail. He was no more punished than if it had been
the kitten who had suffered from his rage." If she
grows up, the grace, beauty, and sweet audacity of
childhood often gain for a little girl a place in her
father's affections; but not to be long enjoyed; an
early betrothal and marriage are the universal
custom.</p>

<p>Engagements take place as early as three years
old, and the bride is sometimes then taken to grow
up with her future husband. Should one inquire
as to the condition of unmarried women in this
country, we are reminded of the famous chapter on
"Snakes in Ireland." There are no snakes in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>Ireland. I am credibly informed, that in many
places it is impossible to find an unmarried girl
of thirteen, and in the course of extensive travels,
covering a period of more than twenty years, I have
myself met but four spinsters or confirmed old
maids. It is needless to add that these were persons
who possessed great native strength of character
and firmness of purpose, and all seemed highly respected
in their own family and social circle. One,
the daughter of a Mujtahid, or highest religious
teacher, was thoroughly versed in all the special
studies of her father, who had educated her. She
understood Persian, Arabic, and Turkish, being
able to read and write them well, and was often
consulted on difficult points in the Koran, by the
Mullahs, who admitted that she understood it better
than they. Another, living in a large family of
several brothers, enjoyed the esteem and affection of
all, and was most sincerely mourned when she died.</p>

<p>These are, however, great exceptions, and considered
as directly opposed to the command of the
Prophet. It is regarded as a cardinal sin not to marry,
and our single ladies are often assured the only
prospect before them is of the eternal pains of hellfire,
as the penalty for the obstinate disobedience in
this particular. Even the lepers, segregated in their
wretched villages, feel the pressure of opinion and
are obliged to marry in accordance with religion.</p>

<p>Theoretically, no girl is married against her will;
but practically, the pressure from her family and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>society is too strong for her to resist, and the same
is much the case with the young men. The choice
of a partner for life being one in which often the
boy has no voice, it follows that the girl has none
whatever. A father engaging his daughter was
asked, "What does the girl think of it herself?"
"She? It is none of her affair; it is my business
whom she marries." Like Browning's Pompilia:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who, all the while, bore from first to last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As brisk a part in the bargain, as yon lamb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought forth from basket, and set out for sale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bears, while they chaffer o'er it; each in turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Patting the curly, calm, unconscious head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the shambles ready round the corner there."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus the girl enters a new home, often to be the
slave of her mother-in-law. As a rule, the married
couple have had no previous acquaintance with each
other.</p>

<p>Such a state of society is hard on both sexes. A
man is bound to a wife who will in all probability
deceive and disobey him, who compasses by fraud
what she cannot obtain by fair means, and who has
no affection for him. She is ignorant; she is no
companion for him mentally; it is not strange that
he dreads to place in her keeping his honor, his
property, and the welfare of his house. I have
heard a young man say, "We are like putting out
a hand into the dark, to receive we know not what.
Of one thing only we are sure; it will be bad." It
is impossible that much unhappiness should not re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>sult,
as shown by the number of divorces, reckoned
by one of themselves as at least forty per cent. of
the marriages. The wonder is that happy marriages
do occur. Some there undoubtedly are, but
in defiance of the system, and not in consequence of
it. When one such comes to our notice, it appears
like a green and refreshing oasis in a monotonous
desert. One lady told us, "I have been married
fifteen years, and my husband and I have never
had a difference." Another said, "He is so kind
to me; he has never yet scolded me for anything I
did." She added, "But I am extremely careful to
avoid what I know he does not like and in all matters
I try my best to please him." It must be said,
however, that one of these men is secretly a believer
in Christ, and the other a follower of the Bab,
in whose system the equality and rights of woman
play a prominent part.</p>

<p>Did space permit we should gladly tell the romantic
history of Qurrat-el-Ayn, the Joan of Arc
of the Babi movement; but in this connection, we
may be pardoned for giving the following sonnet,
evoked by her remarkable life and tragic death:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Quarrat-el-Ayn! not famous far beyond<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her native shore. Not many bards have sung<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wielding her beauty as a magic wand,<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span><span class="i0">Of truth, she went unveiled and unashamed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A woman, in the land where women live<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She broke the bonds of custom, and to give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Bab her aid, she dared the world alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only to fail: death closed the unequal strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Persia blindly wrecked a noble life." ...<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The popular estimate of woman is that she is
naturally inferior, not to be trusted, to be kept continually
under surveillance as a necessary evil, with
something disgraceful in the fact of her existence, a
person to be controlled and kept down from birth
to death. "Why do you take your wife out to walk
with you?" said one brother to another more enlightened.
"I see you promenading outside of the
village with her; she will get out of her proper
place, and neither obey or respect you, if you pamper
her in that way." The younger man replied
with indignation, "Is she not a human being, and
shall I not treat her as such?" The elder answered,
"She must know that her proper position is under
your foot."</p>

<p>A poet says, "A thousand houses are destroyed by
women." Another Moslem authority writes, "Jealousy
and acrimony, as well as weakness of character
and judgment, are implanted in the nature of
women, and incite them to misconduct and vice."
Mohammed says, "Chide those whose refractoriness
you have cause to fear, and beat them." The limit
suggested is, "Not one of you must whip his wife
like whipping a slave."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>
<p>A book containing sage advice warns man
against three things: "First, excess of affection for
a wife, for this gives her prominence and leads to
a state of perversion, when the power is overpowered
and the commander commanded. Second,
consulting or acquainting a wife with secrets or
amount of property." Mohammed also warns, "Not
to entrust to the incapable the substance which God
hath placed with you," and, "Beware, make not
large settlements on women." "Third, Let him
allow her no musical instruments, no visiting out of
doors, or listening to stories."</p>

<p>As to a woman's duty, Mohammed declared that
if the worship of one created being could be permitted
to another, he would have enjoined the worship
of husbands. It seems strange to calculate a
woman's value arithmetically, but in Moslem law
the testimony of two women is equal to that of
one man, a daughter gets half a son's inheritance,
and a wife only an eighth of her husband's property,
if there are children; otherwise a fourth. A
husband does not speak of his wife as such, but uses
some circumlocution as "My house, my child, or the
mother of such a boy." A villager asked the doctor
to come and treat his mother. "How old is she?"
"Thirty." "And how old are you?" "Forty."
"How can she be your mother?" A bystander, filled
with contempt for such obtuseness, whispered, "It
is his wife, but he doesn't like to say so." In like
manner, the children are not taught to say father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>and mother, but the master, the older brother, the
mistress, the lady sister, the older sister.</p>

<p>A comic paper published by Mohammedans in
Russia, and in their own language, has recently had
some amusing pictures bearing on the position of
women. In the first, two women and several men
are coming before the Mullahs for marriage or
divorce; large heads of sugar carried into the presence
hint at bribery as a factor in the case. The
women, who stand mute and submissive, with their
mouths tied up, as is literally the case with many
of them, have evidently nothing to say in the matter.
The second scene shows a man and three boys
sitting around a large bowl of rice, which is rapidly
disappearing before their vigorous onset. The cat
is crunching a bone, but the wife and mother sits
at one side while even the baby in her arms is
given a portion; but she waits till all are satisfied,
and she may come in for the leavings. Again, the
lord and master of the house, stretched upon a divan,
smokes his pipe, a crying child beside him on the
floor. His wife enters, staggering under a heavy
stone water jar on her shoulder, another in her
hand, and a child tied on her back. He exclaims,
"Oh, woman, may God curse you! this child gives
me the headache! come, take it also on your back."</p>

<p>A full two-page colored cartoon depicts the carriage
of a most exalted personage, with the veiled
wife in it rolling through the street, while all men
and boys are turning their backs, and some even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>shutting their eyes in obedience to officers armed
with long whips. A dog also has duteously and
humbly turned his back to the forbidden sight, and
is crouched down with the most virtuous air you
could imagine. When such satires as this can appear,
and the edition of the paper runs up into the
thousands, people are beginning to think.</p>

<p>There is indeed another side to the question, and
all honor to the Moslem men whose eyes are open
to see the wrongs of women, whose hearts pity, and
who venture into the thorny and dangerous path of
reform! Many more, no doubt, feel all these things,
but what can they do? They are so bound in the net
of custom and prejudice, that it is next to impossible
to remedy, in any degree, the existing evils; while
by attempting it, they run the risk of making things
worse, and so shrug their shoulders, and feel there
is nothing to do but to submit.</p>

<p>One husband, sincerely attached to his wife, said
to me, "How glad I should be to see her free as you
are! It is no pleasure to me to have her shrouded
in a black wrap, and shut up behind a curtain; it is
the dream of my life to take her to Europe, and
have her travel with me, as a companion and a
friend. But in this country I dare not deviate in the
least from our customs; she is so pretty, if other
men saw her I should be killed for her sake." This
man was studying English, and the teacher being a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
man, the lady sat behind a screen, listening to the
lessons, and learning faster than the gentleman.
Though he had three other wives, this one (though
being childless) had complete possession of his heart.
They gave a supper to our lady physician and myself,
he doing us the honor to wait on the table, a
thing which, had not my own eyes seen it, I could not
have believed possible in Persia. It was sufficiently
surprising to have him sit at the same table and eat
with us, but how much more so, that with each
course he should rise, change our plate, and serve the
food which the cook brought to the door of the
room. He had never appeared so honorable in our
eyes, as when, thus laying aside the pride of rank
and station, he was "among us as one that served."<br /><br /></p>

<p><br />When one first comes to a Moslem country, a
sentiment of profound pity for the women predominates;
but as it is evident that half the population
cannot be kept in an unnatural and degraded
condition, without entailing disastrous consequences
on the other half, one begins to feel equal sympathy
for the men, who suffer under the disadvantage of
having no true family life, and indeed of being
unable to form a conception of what it is.</p>

<p>The great trouble is the lack of confidence in married
life; as it is a very rare thing to find a wife who
can trust her husband not to divorce her, if it appear
convenient and desirable, or not to add to his wives
if he be able.</p>

<p>Divorce, which a woman may obtain under cer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>tain
rare conditions, is a man's right without restriction.
A woman's only protection is, her dowry
must be paid her, and her husband must pronounce
the sentence of divorce three times. Thus a little
check is put on an angry impulse. Age, poor health,
loss of beauty or eyesight, lack of children, especially
of sons, or the merest whim, may be the excuse
for it. The most pathetic appeals are made to the
lady doctor, by women in dread of divorce.</p>

<p>A wealthy nobleman, married to a young and
beautiful lady of equal rank, the mother of both
sons and daughters, and as reported, with a fair
amount of wedded happiness, was dazzled by a proposed
alliance with a princess of such rank as to
brook no rival. The indispensable condition was
a divorce, and absolute separation from the wife he
had. She knew nothing of her fate till one day,
when visiting at her brother's, word was brought her
she need not return home. That night the wedding
was celebrated with firing of cannon and great
festivities, but the children were crying for their
mother, and for her and them there was no redress.
She immediately went on pilgrimage to a holy
shrine, to pray that her husband and his new wife
might be cursed of God. The man met with some
very signal and public reverses, and transported with
joy, she flew to another sacred place, to call down
more misfortunes on his head.</p>

<p>Many of the divorced women remarry; others
become beggars or maid-servants. As for the chil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>dren,
if the family be wealthy, they remain with the
father; if poor, in case both parents find other partners,
they are often cast adrift to shift for themselves.</p>

<p>On a journey, the wife of the muleteer was seen to
be laying aside part of the tea, sugar, etc., purchased
by the man for their joint use, and was asked
the cause. She replied, "It is necessary to make
some provision for myself against the day when he
shall divorce me; I have had six husbands and he
has had seven wives; what can I expect?" The
couple had been newly married, and this was their
wedding trip.</p>

<p>A sad-faced drudge in our lodging place told us,
"I am the twenty-fifth wife, some are divorced, some
dead; to-morrow it may be my turn to go."</p>

<p>Polygamy is prevalent among the rich who can
afford it, and is regarded by many as highly
meritorious. Some of the poor also practise it, but
most of them have but one wife at a time, and are
comparatively faithful to her. The percentage of
men who live in polygamy is difficult to arrive at,
but a good judge has estimated it at thirty per cent.
The best men seem to be ashamed and to deprecate
it. Some say it is forbidden in the Koran, by the
verse which allows only as many wives as a man
can treat with equity; as they say this is an impossibility,
if a man has more than one consort, to treat
them alike. When asked about the example of the
Prophet, and the holy men, especially the Imams,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>they say, as for Mohammed, he was allowed peculiar
privileges, not granted to other men. Some who
consider the Imams sinless, explain their conduct in
the same way. Those who do not accept this solution
say the Imams did wrong in having a plurality
of wives. When asked about the Shah, they reply
he does wrong in practising polygamy, but it is permitted
to him because he has the power in his hands.</p>

<p>No Moslem woman is supposed to have any right
to require or expect that her husband will be true to
her in the marriage relation, though fidelity to him
is rigorously exacted of her, and her breach of it
is punishable with death.</p>

<p>There may be instances where the women of a
polygamous household agree; the casual stranger,
who visits a harem without any knowledge of the
language, or personal acquaintance with the inmates,
will often be assured that they love each other
fondly, and are more than sisters in friendship; but
the trusted family friend, or the lady doctor, can
tell a very different tale.</p>

<p>Our doctor told me once, she thought the two
women of a certain house, were an exception to the
general rule, and that they really were friends; but
soon after, the older one being sick, she saw a good
deal of her in private, and was obliged sadly to confess
she had been mistaken.</p>

<p>I have myself known of one case, in which the
rival wives were of the same mind. One of our
neighbors had two partners of his joys and sorrows,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>who sometimes joined forces, and gave him a good
beating, so he would be seen flying in hot haste from
his "happy" home. One man said to one of us, "I
don't need to die in order to go to hell; I have it in
my own house; I live there." Another, when told
by the indignant doctor, "Your mode of life is
beastly," replied, "I know it; compared with me the
beasts are decent."</p>

<p>If the wives are in the same house, it is filled with
bitterness and jealousy; if they are in separate houses
or even in different towns, the case is not much better.
If the women were not taught by their religious
leaders that their sufferings are the will of God,
and that it is very meritorious to accept them, and
if they believed any other fate possible, I do not
think they would endure it. They say "Christian
women have their heaven now, but afterwards they
will inherit endless suffering; we have hell in this
life, but hereafter shall come eternal bliss."</p>

<p>"Do we love our husbands?" said one in answer
to a question, "Yes, as much as a sieve holds water."
One of our friends, the third of three wives in one
house, was found by us at her mother's. "Oh, yes,"
she said, "I have come home to stay; I simply could
not bear it any longer; so I hired a woman to take
my place with my husband and came here."</p>

<p>These are regularly married wives, with dowry
rights and the protection of law. What of the poor
temporary hired ones, who come for a longer or
shorter period, and a specified wage? This is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>peculiar shame and blot of the Shiah sect of Islam,
which not only tolerates the vile institution of <i>muti</i>,
but takes it under the sanction of law and custom,
and even permits the ministers of religion to be the
chief promoters of it, many of them accumulating
wealth by this base means.</p>

<p>You will sometimes hear it stated that there are
no houses of prostitution in Moslem lands. In
Persia, at least, the institution may not exist in
precisely the same form as in other countries, where
it is under the ban of the law, and in defiance of public
opinion, but it is here, in a form which utterly
depraves the mind of the people, and obliterates for
them all moral distinctions, poisoning family life at
the very fountain. It is impossible to go fully into
this subject: the details are too revolting, but one
or two instances may suffice.</p>

<p>We know of a girl who was sold for five dollars
by her family, and taken by her brother to a city
where a Khan wished for her during his temporary
sojourn; on his return he discarded her, and she
came back to her family, her social standing in no
wise affected by the transaction, which was merely a
matter of business. An old roué, who had already
had over thirty wives, sitting like a spider in his
web, from his upper window spied a pretty young
girl in the street. Her family was poor, and he
tempted them with money and large promises, and
sent silks and satins for the trousseau. It was all
but done, when some missionary ladies remonstrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>on her behalf, and showed how she would soon come
back to them ruined and diseased. So she escaped
for that time.</p>

<p>In the house of my Turkish teacher, I was introduced
to "my brother's wife." Inquiring about her
some months after I was told, "My brother has no
wife; he has never been married." "But who, then,
was that woman who was presented to me as his
wife?" "That was a <i>muti</i> woman; he treated her
so badly she could not stay her time out, but asked
to be excused and went away without her money."</p>

<p>The effect of polygamy and divorce on children is
very bad. A son, particularly, seeing his mother
treated with disrespect, feels contempt for her, and
will in many cases tyrannize over and beat her. Another
effect is that curiosity is stimulated, and a
premature and unhallowed knowledge is gained of
the most sacred relations of life, which is contaminating,
and destroys for ever the innocence of childhood.
As a matter of course, there is jealousy
between the children of different wives, and
estrangement and hatred destroy family affection.
One who has seen the children of Sarah in the place
of honor, presented proudly to the visitor and indulged
in every wish, and at the same time the
children of Hagar standing humbly in the presence
as servants, or hanging about the door outside, will
not soon forget the contrast.</p>

<p>In such a house there is nothing whatever to
teach a boy the possibility of leading a clean life;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>purity is not expected of him, and often the most
elaborate provision is made to satisfy the lusts of
the flesh. The mother of a young boy will hire a
female servant for him as part of the regular family.
The effect of such an element on the whole household
may be imagined. Bitter also is the retribution
often suffered for such breaches of the law of God.
Barrenness is a most common thing, and the Moslem
population does not increase but barely replaces itself,
while the Jews and Christians, whose family life
is comparatively pure, survive and win in the race
of life.</p>

<p>If a Moslem woman were sure of her place in her
husband's affection and her position in the home, I
am certain she would prove herself as worthy as
any; for I have observed some families among them
where the tradition or custom of the clan is against
polygamy and divorce, and the women in those
homes are loyal to their husbands' interests, ready to
work hard and deny themselves for the home which
they know is guaranteed to them and their children.
We are very apt to think that having known nothing
better and having nothing else to hope for, they
must be contented and reconciled to their lot. This
reminds one of the answer of the old fishwife, when
one remonstrated with her on the habit of skinning
eels alive, "Oh, they don't mind it; they are used
to it." This is far from being the case, and it is
especially true of those who, by travel or contact
with Christians, have had their eyes opened to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>fact, that in other countries their sisters enjoy advantages
of education, and are objects of respect
denied to themselves; that Christian women are
trusted with freedom, and as a rule prove worthy
of it.</p>

<p>Yet the fact remains: these women and girls cannot
be educated and emancipated, without bringing
to bear on the social fabric influences which would
result in its disintegration and destruction, with
nothing better to replace it. Galling as are the curtain
and the veil, they cannot be dispensed with, for
fear of worse evils. Ignorance and seclusion are
better than education and liberty without moral restraint.</p>

<p>While polygamy and divorce exist, and there is
no standard of purity equally applicable to both
sexes, more freedom than woman now possesses
cannot with safety be granted her. I fail to see any
remedy, but in the doctrine and practice of Christianity.
The fact known to be true of a school in
Syria, points out the solution of the problem. Of
the pupils of a Protestant school, conducted there,
for many years, and largely attended by Moslem
girls, it is stated a case has never been known where
a pupil who had passed through their hands had
been divorced or obliged to accept a second wife in
her home.</p>

<p>These women have learned lessons of duty, of personal
responsibility to God, of self-respect, self-control,
kindness, and love, that cause the hearts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>their husbands safely to trust in them. Can we say
as much for any other system of education or religion?</p>

<p>Certainly Mohammedanism, with its twin evils
of polygamy and divorce, has not only failed to elevate
woman, but has everywhere resulted in her
degradation. More pitiful than the more obvious
wrongs inflicted by this system, is the effect produced
upon character. Being distrusted, she has become
untrustworthy; being abused, she has become
abusive; and every evil passion is given free rein.</p>

<p>The bad wife is described by a Moslem writer as
"a rebel for contumacy and unruliness; as a foe
for contemptuousness and reproach; and as a thief
for treacherous designs upon her husband's purse."
She becomes an adept in the use of woman's weapon,
the tongue; "an unruly evil full of deadly poison."
"An angry woman in a passion of rage, pouring
forth torrents of curses and invectives, is a fury
incarnate." The jealousy of rival wives often leads
to dreadful crimes. One woman became blind from
vitriol thrown in her face by another wife; an only
son, most precious and of high rank, was poisoned
in his innocent babyhood by his mother's rival; a
young bride attempted suicide in her despair.</p>

<p>These are but instances; every harem has its unwritten
tragedies.</p>

<p>Not the least feature of the moral ruin into which
they have fallen, is the impurity which seems to
permeate every thought; so that they delight in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>obscene songs, vile allusions, and impure narratives.
A missionary lady visiting at the home of a highborn
Moslem woman, very religious and devout according
to their standards, was so shocked by the
character of the conversation with which her hostess
was trying to entertain her, as to be forced to say,
"If you talk to me like this, I shall be obliged to
excuse myself and leave your house."</p>

<p>Saddest of all, they often become so depraved
that they not only connive at the evils of the system,
but actively promote them. A lady going on a
long pilgrimage herself chose and brought two
young girls, to be her husband's concubines in her
absence. A mother cultivates in her son the passions
she should teach him to subdue. The present mode
of life is supposed to be perpetuated in Paradise,
where every true believer is to have "seventy-two
wives, and eighty thousand slaves," all Houris
specially created for him. The place for Moslem
woman is not definitely specified.</p>

<p>The religion that robs them of happiness in this
life, and gives no hope of it in the next, lays the
same obligations upon them as on men, viz., the five
foundations of practice: the witnessing to the Unity
of God and the apostleship of the Prophet; observing
the five daily seasons of prayer; alms-giving;
the fast of Ramazan; and the pilgrimage to Mecca.</p>

<p>In Persia is added the mourning for a month, for
Hassan and Hossein, the martyred grandsons of
Mohammed. As in all religions, women are most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>zealous and devoted in the performance of these
duties, but the practice of Islam has nothing to
satisfy their soul hunger. Their belief in God is
cruel fatalism, and all their rites work no change of
heart, and give no peace of conscience.</p>

<p>The Gospel comes to them with a special appeal,
and bringing its own message. That they should
have any message, or be considered at all, is news to
them; they are so used to neglect and disrespect.
When two of us, at the invitation of a lady of rank,
attended their Passion Play, we sat with her on the
ground, among a crowd of women, who were pushed
about by ushers with long poles, while the "lords of
creation" sat comfortably above on chairs, and in
booths.</p>

<p>So accustomed are Moslem women to being
hustled about that they wonder at Christ's "Forbid
them not," which we are apt to apply only to the
children, forgetting that it was spoken for the
mothers. It is sometimes most amusing to see a
pompous dignitary crowd his way into the dispensary
of the lady physician, and when made with
difficulty to understand that only women are treated
there, retire crestfallen. There at least women have
not only the first, but the only entrance. They are
not surprised at the Syrophenician woman being
called "a dog." They are used to the epithet and
employ it themselves. One often hears one berating
her own offspring, as "child of a dog." When
driven to desperation by want, the Persian woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>can be as defiant, shameless, and persistent, as she
of old before the unjust judge. Not unfrequently
mobs of women led by a woman, attack the gates of
the governors, demanding bread.</p>

<p>Their often miserable and diseased condition of
health makes them feel how tender is Christ's compassion
in His miracles of healing. They also have
often suffered much from quack nostrums, "only to
grow worse." In any crowd of village women, one
may see an old hag, bent and "bowed together&mdash;not
able to lift herself up," and there is no more pitiful
sight than the old women of Persia. A neighbor, a
hundred years old, always appeals to our charity on
the ground of being "an orphan."</p>

<p>Their life and occupations are so identical with
those of Bible times, that they feel at once familiar
with the scenes described in the New Testament.
Every morning, a village woman must mix the
leaven in her meal for the daily baking, must sweep
her mud floor, and often two of them sit at the hand
mill grinding wheat or salt. Every one who can,
wears a necklace of silver coins, and counts each
one precious. The custom of covering the face "lest
a man look upon a woman" is so inwrought into
their earliest training that they are able to draw
their veils <i>instantly</i>, whatever they are doing, if a
man approaches.</p>

<p>They marvel, as did Christ's disciples, that He
talked with a woman, especially of a foreign race,
and that He asked for a drink of water, for to-day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>the Persians think a cup defiled if a Christian drink
from it. In a wedding procession in a village, the
musicians lead with fife and drum, and "the virgins"
follow in all the finery they can muster. At times of
mourning also, they act just as the Gospels describe.
Friends gather to "weep and bewail." I have seen a
roomful of women swaying and sobbing, while a
mother chanted a plaintive refrain: "Alas! alas!"
repeating the beloved name of the dead; often tearing
her hair, and beating her breast. I have often
seen blear-eyed women, who said they had become
so by excessive weeping over the death of a child.
To such comes Jesus' message, "Weep not."</p>

<p>Religious observances in Persia are such as give
special significance to Gospel teaching. I had a
visitor whose lips were continually mumbling while
she fingered her beads. She told me she was making
merit, by repeating the hundred names of Allah.
Often when in their homes, our hostess will excuse
herself, because "it is the hour of prayer," and going
to a corner of the same room, will go through the
forms and gestures of Mohammedan worship.
"Vain repetitions" they seem, when we know the
words are Arabic, a language she does not understand;
and as in the midst of her prayers she calls
out directions to her servants, one can see there is
no devotion in them.</p>

<p>Fasting is a terrible burden, when, for a month,
from dawn to dark, not a morsel of food, or drop of
water, or a whiff of the loved cigarette or pipe can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>pass their lips. The people acknowledge that it is
the cause of quarrelling and reviling, so irritable do
they become under the strain, yet they dare not
"break their fast" for fear of others.</p>

<p>All who can afford it make the long pilgrimage to
Mecca, or in lieu of that to Kerbela or Meshed; and
bear thereafter the holy name of Haji, Kerbelai, or
Meshedi. To them it is a new thought, given by
Christ to the woman of Sychar, that no special location
is "the place where men ought to worship."
Of all His words none receive more approval from
the Persian woman than His teachings on marriage
and divorce. They often say to us, "How happy you
Christian women are with no fear of divorce!"</p>

<p>Not only Christ's teachings but His character
makes an impression, and His gentleness and purity
especially attract them. We are shocked at the
coarse questions: "Can God have a Son? Was Jesus
married?" but as they hear the story of His marvellous
life a look of awe sometimes comes into their
faces, as the vision of "the White Christ" dawns
upon them.</p>

<p>A Moslem lady said to me, "I cannot read, but
one woman in our harem can, and she reads the
Injil (New Testament) to us; we can never get
enough of it." Another, making a call of condolence
upon me, said, "There is only one book that
can comfort you; you have told me about it; now
I tell you."</p>

<p>Those who have grown up in the midst of free in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>stitutions,
under the protection of law, and in the
light of publicity, can really have no idea of the
difficulties to be encountered by the Moslem woman
who becomes a Christian. A man can escape by
flight, but this refuge is denied her. Even if she
wish to keep her change of faith secret, it is impossible
to do so, and be true to her new-found Saviour.
The whole warp and woof of her daily life are so
bound up with religious observances, and the least
failure to perform them is so jealously noted, the
least endeavor to fulfil the commands of the Gospel
with regard to Sabbath rest, reading the Word, or
secret prayer is at once the object of remark and
criticism; often of active opposition. Were it not so
her changed life and character mark her out as walking
in a different path and measuring her conduct by
another standard from those who surround her.
She is most happy if, as sometimes happens, her
husband, brother, father, or son is in sympathy with
her, and has perhaps been the means of her enlightenment;
or if a sister or friend is of like faith, and
they can strengthen each other. But often she
stands entirely alone in her family and social circle,
and must bear much petty persecution, even if she
is not turned out of her home, does not lose her
children, or her life. In such circumstances, if a
convert stand firm, and even win her enemies to
accept Jesus, it is a genuine miracle. Yet it is seen
to occur.</p>

<p>Words cannot tell the beauty of some of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>transformed faces: the sweetness plucked from bitterness,
the "lily among thorns." The present help
of a living Saviour and the wonderful hopes for the
future have made life an entirely different thing.
One such who had borne a heavy yoke in her youth,
had suffered deeply, and with rancor and rebellion
in her heart against him who had blighted her life,
has learned to forgive and pray for the one who so
deeply injured her; and her daily household life is a
triumph of grace. During a cholera epidemic, when
all around were panic-stricken, she and her sisters,
who have found the like precious refuge, were perfectly
calm, saying, "Why should we fear death?
It can only take us to Jesus, which is far better;
as living or dying we are His."</p>

<p>One old woman walked three miles and back once
a week in order to be instructed in the Gospel, and
is never satisfied, always wants to learn more, and
takes great pains to remember texts and prayers.
Once after the others had gone she caught hold of
me, saying, "Do you think I walk all these miles,
with my blind eyes, to learn nothing? Come and
teach me some more." Showing some hard barley
bread, she said, "No one shall say I come for food;
I have brought my own bread."</p>

<p>Another woman, whose paralytic son had learned
to read the Bible, said, "At first I did not care for it,
but little by little I got to love it." It worked a
transformation in that humble home; the son in his
first despair had attempted to poison himself; but he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>learned to praise God for the affliction which was
the means of acquainting him with his Saviour.
The mother instead of considering the helpless
young man a burden, and complaining of the misfortune,
nursed him for years with such rare patience
and tenderness, that we marvelled to see it.
The contrast between her and her neighbors is
marked; her face is gentle and kind, her voice sweet.
She is faithful, industrious, and honest; for a whole
summer when a family was absent, she went alone
every week to sweep the house, and not a thing was
ever missed, though, in general, we expect nothing
better than pilfering and theft from the women of
the country.</p>

<p>In one city is gathered a little band of believing
women, who hold a weekly prayer meeting, and "it
is most touching to hear their simple requests and
pleading for this and that one still outside the fold.
When I was going to B&mdash;&mdash; they gave me a message
for the sisters there. They had long taken a
special interest in the work in that place, and never
failed to remember it at the throne of grace. They
had heard several women there were secret believers,
but afraid to confess their faith openly, so they sent
word to them that they themselves were once in the
same state. They feared to confess Christ before
men, but He had promised to be with them, and
He had given them grace to come out boldly, and He
had kept His promise to give peace and joy in all
times of trial and difficulty. They then begged their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>sisters to do as they had done, to take the plunge,
trusting in His power to help them, and they would
find all their fears taken away and courage given
instead."</p>

<p>Such, living and dying, was the experience of
Almass of Urumia. She had become a Christian,
and her husband also had suffered great persecution
from her own family on this account. Her husband
being away, she was living in her father's
house, and her stepmother would not even give her
enough to eat, constantly reviled her, made her life
bitter, and did her best to prevent her praying. Being
stricken with consumption, she went to the hospital,
where she rejoiced in Christian companionship
and instruction, but at the last, she was taken to her
own home to die. A young Nestorian doctor, called
in to attend her, witnessed her triumphant death;
himself but a nominal Christian, he exclaimed,
"Would that I could die so happy!" Her whole
trust was in Jesus, and her only anxiety that her
little daughter should be trained in the same faith.</p>

<p>Almass means diamond, and in the day when the
Lord "makes up His jewels" she will surely be
among them.</p>

<h2><a name="XIX" id="XIX"></a>XIX</h2>

<h2>THE CONDITION OF MOHAMMEDAN WOMEN IN BALUCHISTAN</h2>


<p>In the degraded position of its women is to be
seen the worst fruit of the religion of Islam. I will
quote from the Government Report of British
Baluchistan: "Throughout the Province, but especially
among the Afghans and Brahuis, the position
of woman is one of extreme degradation; she is not
only a mere household drudge, but she is the slave
of man in all his needs, and her life is one of continual
and abject toil. No sooner is a girl fit for
work than her parents send her to tend cattle and she
is compelled to take her part in all the ordinary
household duties. Owing to the system of <i>walwar</i>
in vogue among the Afghans, a girl, as soon as she
reaches nubile age, is, for all practical purposes, put
up for auction sale to the highest bidder. The
father discourses on her merits, as a beauty or as a
housekeeper, in the public meeting places, and invites
offers from those who are in want of a wife.
Even the more wealthy and more respectable
Afghans are not above this system of thus lauding
the human wares which they have for sale. The betrothal
of girls who are not yet born is frequent, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>a promise of a girl thus made is considered particularly
binding.</p>

<p>"It is also usual for an award of compensation for
blood to be ordered to be paid in this shape of girls,
some of whom are living, while others are not yet
born.</p>

<p>"Similar customs prevail among the Jhalawan
Brahuis, but they have not yet extended to all the
Balneh tribes, though there are signs that the poorer
classes are inclined to adopt them. The exchange
of girls, however, among the Baluchis and the framing
of conditions, regarding any offspring which
may result from the marriage, indicate that among
this race also, women are regarded in much the same
light.</p>

<p>"These details may appear to be beside the mark
in discussing the classification of women as dependents
or actual workers, but I relate them with
the object of showing that woman in Baluchistan is
regarded as little more than a chattel. For where
such a state of parental feeling or rather want of
feeling is to be found, is it surprising to find that
woman is considered either as a means for increasing
man's comforts, in the greater ease with which
they are procured by her toil, or an object for the
gratification of his animal passions?</p>

<p>"A wife in Baluchistan must not only carry water,
prepare food, and attend to all ordinary household
duties, but she must take the flocks out to graze,
groom her husband's horse, and assist in the cultiva<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>tion.
So far is this principle carried out among the
Jajars of Zhob, that it is considered incumbent on a
married woman of this tribe to provide means by her
own labor for clothing herself, her husband, and her
children, and she receives no assistance, monetary
or otherwise, for this purpose from her husband, but
in addition to all this, the husband hopes that she
may become the mother of girls who will fetch as
high a price as their mother did before them. Hence
it happens that among Afghans, polygamy is only
limited by the purchasing power of a man; and a
wife is looked on as a better investment than cattle,
for in a country where drought and scarcity are
continually present, the risk of loss of animals is
great, whilst the offspring of a woman, if a girl, will
assuredly fetch a high price." So far the census
report.</p>

<p>Slavery, polygamy, and concubinage exist
throughout the Kelat state and Baluchi area. Slavery
is of a domestic character, but the slave is often
in a degraded and ignorant condition, and in times
of scarcity almost starved by his owner.</p>

<p>The female slaves often lead the lives of common
prostitutes, especially among the Baluch tribes,
where the state of the women generally seems very
degraded.</p>

<p>Regarding polygamy, the average man is unable
to afford more than one wife, but the higher classes
often possess from thirty to sixty women, many of
them from the Hazare tribes of Afghanistan, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>women and children, during the rebellion in the late
Amir's reign, were sold over into Baluchistan and
Afghanistan. In nearly every village of any size
one sees the Hazare women, and the chief will talk
of buying them as a farmer at home will speak of
purchasing cattle.</p>

<p>Worse than all, one has daily illustrations of the
truth that the sins of the fathers are visited on their
families, in the degraded victims of inherited and
acquired disease who come to the missionary doctor
for relief, healing being impossible in many of
the cases of these poor women. Pure selfishness
characterizes the men in their relationship with their
wives. All must not and cannot be told in illustration
of this, but what happened a short time ago in
our out-patient department of the Zenana Mission
Hospital is an instance.</p>

<p>A young Brahui mother was brought in order to
be relieved from suffering by an operation which
would require her to remain in the hospital a fortnight.
When this was proposed, the woman who
brought her said at once, "If she does that her husband
will send her away." The poor girl had to depart
untreated, because the husband feared his
bodily comforts might be less if she were not there
to minister to them.</p>

<p>May those who see this dark picture of the effect
of Islam on womanhood in the East, do all that is
in them to bring the glorious light of the Gospel of
Christ to their suffering sisters.</p>

<h2><a name="XX" id="XX"></a>XX</h2>

<h2>IN SOUTHERN INDIA</h2>


<p>In South India the Mohammedans have been
more or less influenced by the Christian and
heathen communities by which they are surrounded.
Many of them, especially those belonging to the
trading communities, have married women of
Hindoo birth who have become nominal Mohammedans.</p>

<p>Amongst the higher classes, especially amongst
the rich and well-to-do, polygamy is still common,
though there are many men who have only one wife
and few who have more than two. As a rule, in the
city of Madras, each wife will have a small place of
her own. It is a rare thing for several wives to live
in the same house. It is, however, extremely difficult
to find out, without undue questioning, who
the various inmates are. Often a house will be quite
full of women and children of all ages, but as a rule
the true explanation will be that the head of the
house has many sons, each of whom has brought his
wife to live in his old home, and all live in strict
outward obedience to the mother-in-law. How
much depends upon this mother-in-law! When she
is a kindly, peaceable woman, things go fairly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>smoothly, but terrible things happen in homes where
the mother-in-law is harsh and severe.</p>

<p>In all the homes the purdah is strictly kept, and
alas! who can tell what dark deeds are <i>occasionally</i>
done in these secluded homes. Still education is
spreading rapidly, and with it changes must and do
come. Young educated Mohammedans are now
wanting educated wives. The principal Mohammedans
in Madras come very much in contact with
Europeans and are considerably influenced by them,
and we do not see the Moslem as he appears in
Moslem countries under Moslem rule, but as he appears
after living for generations under the British
flag. If he disagrees with public opinion (which
no doubt he often does) he keeps his opinion very
much to himself, and with graceful courtesy agrees
to differ.</p>

<p>The purdah system is one that brings with it terrible
evils, and yet it is a system to which those who
apparently suffer from it most, cling the most
closely. The secluded women themselves look upon
it as an honor, and a proof of the value set upon
them. Even the very poorest people seclude their
wives; while soldiers on the march hang up blankets,
sheets, and even rags to form a little enclosure for
their wives at each halting place. Though individual
women will often speak of their many
troubles they rarely mention their isolation, and
truly pity those of other nations who are not taken
equal care of. With education this aspect of affairs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>will change, and girls who have been educated in
mission schools view things in a very different light
and no doubt long for greater freedom.</p>

<p>The best and only method of helping these poor
secluded women is to spread amongst them the
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Nothing else can
really help them, and the great means of doing so is
by education. Educating them to read so that they
can read of Him in their seclusion, and educating
them as thoroughly as possible in schools and house-to-house
visitation so that they can understand what
they read.</p>

<p>Let me give one illustration of what can be done in
this way. Some years ago I was called in to a small
zenana, where the family were of noble birth but
extremely poor; so proud that they would all rather
starve than take money or tell of their troubles.
Three little girls read with me, and very bright and
intelligent I found them. The mother was in bad
health and seemed sad, though her husband was always
very kind to her. The girls read regularly and
got very fond of their lessons and wished they could
live like English girls. One day I was told that the
elder girl was to be married the next week. She
was in great distress, for she knew nothing of the
man who had been chosen for her and feared
naturally that he might be uneducated and ignorant.
I was unable to go to the wedding, and to my great
distress the young bride was taken away to a distant
town without my seeing her again. Some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>months passed and then I got a letter from a
stranger. It was well written and well expressed in
English and I found to my great delight that it was
from the husband of my old pupil. He said he felt
he must write to thank me for having educated his
wife to be a friend and companion for him. He had
heard from a friend that some girls of his own class
were being educated in Madras and he had asked for
one in marriage. His dread for years had been to
be bound to an ignorant woman and now his fears
were dispersed; his wife was a great pleasure to him
and her judgment of great use. He added, "I can
only think that her progress has been due to her
study of the Bible, and I want you to send me a
copy that we may study together." He is dead now
and the girl widow is in great distress. She says:
"I have been in the light and am now back in the
dark." This shows what can be done by education
to raise a people so degraded as many Mohammedans
are.</p>

<p>The part of South India where the Mohammedans
are most independent is the "Nizam's Dominion,"
which is under the control of the Nizam
of Hyderabad (subject, of course, to England).
Hyderabad is a large walled city, crowded with
rather fierce-looking Mohammedans, and it is only
of late years that English people have been allowed
within the walls without an escort. Even at the
present day no English live inside the walls. Everything
inside is purely Mohammedan, and the Eng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>lish
live at Secunderabad, where the English troops
are stationed, just a few miles off.</p>

<p>In Hyderabad, were it not for H. H. the Nizam,
many of the Nawabs would be glad to bring their
wives out. Quite a number of the leading nobles
have but one wife and glory in the fact. The Crown
Prince (Sahibzada) has been married lately to a
lady of noble family. This was probably the first
Nizam to get married. The Nizam, from the fear
of intrigue, fills his harem with low-class women.
Some of the nobles bring their wives out of purdah
as soon as they leave the state on a holiday.</p>

<p>Polygamy is still common, especially among the
well-to-do. A ready purchase of slaves, during the
great famine of 1900, as concubines, proves that this
evil still exists. Few men have "many" wives, however.</p>

<p>The effect on home life of this system is evident.
The Sahibzada (the next Nizam) when a boy was
taken from the palace, his home, to escape the evils
and temptations of a royal zenana. He lived in a
large house with only his tutor and guardians till
his marriage. A thoughtful munshi who was
anxious about his children's morals, deplored a system
that made the mother so ignorant of the outside
world and so unable to direct a young son aright.</p>

<p>Let me give you a few of my experiences with
regard to Mussulman women, especially during my
stay in Hyderabad. One zenana we used to visit
belonged to an old man who professed to be a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>reformer, but whose women were still in strict purdah.
He several times told us that he would be delighted
if we could persuade his wife and daughters
to go out with us, but of course they would not hear
of such a thing. To their minds it is only the very
poor and degraded who wander about unveiled or
even drive in an open carriage, and would not all the
ladies of their acquaintance be horrified at the bare
idea of their leaving their old habits. So that all
our arguments and persuasion were useless, and the
husband went on writing his papers on the need of
reform in the treatment of their women. With this
lady and her daughters we one day went to a fair
for women only. We had to submit to having our
carriage covered with a very large sheet so that no
eye could see through the closed venetians, and
when, after great difficulty, the lady had been placed
in the carriage we drove to the enclosure where the
fair was to be held. Right into the enclosure drove
the carriage, and then the ladies, carefully shrouded
in sheets, were conducted through a narrow gateway
into a second enclosure, and there were thousands
of women and children. Not a man was to
be seen anywhere. It was so strange to see them
wandering about freely in their bright-colored garments
and to remember the streets of the great city
they had come from, where hardly a woman is ever
seen. These women never crossed the threshold of
their houses before perhaps, so it was like fairyland
to them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>
<p>We found one large, gaily decorated erection belonging
to one of the Nawabs of Hyderabad, and the
women called us in and plied us with many questions,
and then begged us to go to their house to
see them. We went one day to find these new
friends. After driving two or three miles we came
to a quaint walled village, passed under the gateway,
and were directed to the great man's house. We
were told he had two hundred women in his zenana.
In front of the house we saw a young man with a
drawn sword, just about to mount his horse. He
seemed much amused when we told him we wanted
to go and see the ladies, but he conducted us in to see
the head of the house. He was very polite, and
asked us why we had come, etc. We told him our
commission and showed our Gospel, and at last he
said, "Oh, yes! You can go in." So we were conducted
to the other side of the courtyard and came to
an enormous iron gate. A little door in the middle
of it was opened for us to squeeze through, and we
were in the zenana.</p>

<p>Outside were plenty of sun and air, a grand, spacious
courtyard with beds of flowers, and arched
verandahs with large cushions to sit on and lean
against.</p>

<p>Inside was a narrow courtyard which gave you
the impression of not being big enough for all the
women and children who crowded round. No
garden, no flowers, no pretty verandahs, nor
cushions. Old ladies and young girls, my heart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>sank as I saw them all shut in together in this
prison. They were very pleased for us to sing for
them, but it seemed impossible to talk to them.
Even if <i>one</i> wanted to listen the others would not
let her. We always came away with a sad feeling.
The woman who first asked us to go seemed to be
in disgrace when we went the second time, and
would not come near us, and there seemed to be
quite a little world to itself of intrigue and quarrel,
joy, and sorrow, and sin in there. One old lady
would have sung to her the quaint Hindustani bhajam
"Rise, pilgrim, get ready, the time is fast going,"
but she did not want to hear about our Lord
Jesus.</p>

<p>One day, when walking up a street in Hyderabad
city selling Gospels, a boy called us into a large
house. Here we found a little Nawab being taught
by his teacher, who was very polite. The great
houses give you a curious feeling; all is grand and
spacious, but nothing is comfortable or home-like.
Great verandahs and balconies all round the central
courtyard and garden. After hearing our errand,
the young Nawab offered to take us to his mother
and grandmother. We went with him. In one
corner of the courtyard was a funny little hole, we
could not call it a door, with a dirty piece of sacking
hanging in front of it. We went through and
found ourselves in the zenana. Crowds of women
and a dirty, dull, dreary-looking place are all that
stays in my memory; but we were not allowed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>look long, for no sooner did the old grandmother
find we had the Gospel of Jesus, than she had us
hustled out. In vain the boy and younger woman
pleaded for us to stay. She would not hear of it,
so we had to go. We left some Gospels with the
boy. The teacher begged for the whole Bible, which
we sold him a few days later. Into many zenanas
we went in this way, but we did not get invited a
second time as a rule, and we generally find that having
once been able to tell the Gospel in a Mussulman
house, if we do go a second time, we find the women
primed with stock arguments against us.</p>

<p>We find we get nearest to them in the medical
work. We hear tales and stories in the dead of
night then, when sitting with them, which we do not
get a hint of at other times. I remember a woman
once showing me her arm all covered with cuts
which she said her husband had done to her because
she had been fighting with the other wife. We, with
our ideas of freedom and liberty, may think these
women unhappy, but <i>they</i> do not seem to be more
so than our own women. They are quite used to
their own life and look down upon us poor things,
who are so degraded that we allow men to see us
freely with no shame! They see no privation in not
being allowed to go out, or to see the world, and
yet it is a suicidal system. For the women have not
the least idea of what the men and boys are doing.</p>

<p>Many a time have I seen a mother try to chastize
her boy, but he had only to get to the door and slip
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>out and she could not go after him. Since the girls
can never go out they do not need much education
of any sort, and the husband knows the wife has no
knowledge whatever of the world outside, so what is
the use of talking to her? So amongst Mussulmans
there is stagnation, and they of nearly all the people
in India make least progress. Ninety-five per cent.
of them are classed as illiterate in the last census!</p>

<p>Still progress is being made, we feel quite sure,
and one thing seems to prove this. Though the
Mohammedans in South India are backward and full
of things to be deplored, yet they are innocent of
many things which are evidently carried on in other
Mohammedan countries. We, in South India, who
have for years worked amongst Moslems never
heard of the customs which seem to prevail in Egypt.
Divorce is rarely heard of. Possibly it is too expensive,
as the husband must return the dower. A
woman being married to half a dozen husbands in
succession is unheard of. Surely this shows that
where education spreads and where Christianity, unconsciously
perhaps, permeates the whole, there is a
brighter day dawning for Islam. What is wanted
is more teachers, more helpers to take up the work
of spreading the knowledge of the Lord in Moslem
lands.</p>

<h2>THE MOHAMMEDAN WOMEN OF TURKESTAN</h2>


<p>Among the numerous nations and tribes which adhere
to the doctrine of Mohammed, the condition of
women is of course not everywhere the same. In
the vicinity of Europe, e. g., in European Turkey,
the influence of European morality and customs has
become more and more prevailing in spite of the
resistance of Moslem priests. Another difference
in the condition of women, which can be observed
everywhere and which we shall occasionally refer to,
arises from their social position; among the richer
classes a woman must submit to rules and customs
different from those which are standard among the
poorer classes. The fundamental views, however,
are the same; the evil is one, though its outward
appearance may differ in some respects.</p>

<p>The misfortune of a Mohammedan woman begins
at her birth, for instead of rejoicing at the arrival
of her little daughter, the mother complains that she
is not a son. She knows that a girl will leave her
at the age of about fourteen, in order to live in her
husband's house, and after that she will hardly have
any connection with her mother, whereas a son will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>stay at his mother's house and support her in case
she should be divorced from her husband. Moreover
the mother is anxious lest her husband dismiss
her and take another wife. In consequence the
mother feels less affection for her daughter than she
would have felt for a son; she takes little care of her
and neglects her. When about six years old the little
girl begins to do housework; she is ordered to carry
water, to sweep the house, to do kitchen-work, and
so on. For the least mistake she is scolded and
beaten, and even if it happens without any reason,
she is not allowed to complain or to defend herself.
By this treatment the mother prepares her for the
hard lot which awaits her. Sometimes also she will
exclaim: "If you had had good fortune, you would
have been a boy and not a girl." The father treats
her with no less cruelty, so as to give her the impression
that she is indeed an unfortunate creature
whom God does not love.</p>

<p>At meal times girls take the last place and must be
content with what others leave for them. When on
holidays or on other occasions boys get presents, the
girls go away empty-handed. Even for boy's dress
more is spent than for that of the girls.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Moslem Women of the Better Class in Street Dress</span> (Syria)</span>
</div>

<p><br />The teaching of girls is generally confined to
prayers and a few chapters of the Koran, which they
learn by heart mechanically. Very seldom are they
taught to read and write. The exceptions are few
and are always the only children of the rich or the
noble. By these exceptions we know that Moham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>medan
girls are in every respect sufficiently gifted
for a higher education. Many of them have become
prominent scholars or artists, perfectly able to rival
men. This has been proved by the prose works
and poems of Zubdat-ul-Nissa (that is, Flower of
Women)&mdash;by those of Leilai&mdash;and in modern times
by the Persian woman Zarin Tadj, still better known
by her surname Qurat-ul-Ain (that is, "Eyes' Comfort").
This woman descended from a priest's
family, her father as well as her uncle and father-in-law
had been great theologians, and her cousin, to
whom she was married, was a distinguished scholar.
Her extraordinary beauty seems to have been surpassed
only by her intellect and character. When
but a child she took a great interest in the conversations
on science which were often carried on in
her family, and surprised everybody by her sharp
wit and rich mind.</p>

<p>When later on she became acquainted with the
doctrines of the Bab, a new leader, who appeared in
Persia about the middle of last century, she was so
deeply impressed by them that she entered into
intercourse with him, and in spite of the resistance
of her family, appeared in public in order to proclaim
her master's doctrines.</p>

<p>Let us try to give Mohammedan women a share in
the higher spiritual life of their western sisters, and
the slave creatures who serve only their husbands'
pleasure and ease will become companions in his
life-work and educators of his children. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>would produce a perfect change in Moslem family-life.</p>

<p>This vision of the future, however, is not yet fulfilled.
The Mohammedan girl spends her childhood
in a dreary way, knowing that until her fourteenth
or fifteenth year life will not be changed.
Then her parents will marry her to a man, in the
choice of whom they will be led by financial reasons
only. The young man's mother or some other elder
relation of his chooses a bride for him, and examines
the girl with regard to her health and bodily charms.
Sometimes the young people are allowed to exchange
a few words with each other in presence
of the mother, but to get acquainted with each other
as in Christian lands is considered superfluous.
After marriage she is a slave not only to her husband,
but also to her parents-in-law, towards whom
she must behave most courteously, and whom she
must serve sometimes even before serving her husband.
Every morning she rises first and cleans the
house; then she must bring her father-in-law water
to wash himself, and afterwards his repast. Prudence
makes her try to gain the affection of her
parents-in-law, that they may protect her, in case
her husband should dismiss her. Moreover, in the
first year after her marriage a young wife is not
allowed to answer the questions of her parents and
brothers-in-law save by bowing or shaking her
head; only if no one else is present, she may talk
to them. In the fourth year she is permitted to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>swer
by saying "no" or "yes"; after the birth of a
child, however, she may talk to every one. Besides,
it is considered unbecoming that in the presence of
her parents-in-law she should sit near her husband
or occupy herself with her children. The only
change and pleasure in a married woman's life are
the visits which she exchanges every now and then
with her parents, relations, and friends, as well as
the weddings and religious festivities which she is
allowed to attend.</p>

<p>The greatest misfortune in the life of a Mohammedan
woman, however, is the absolute uncertainty
of the duration of her marriage, which robs her of
all real happiness. According to Moslem law, every
Mohammedan is entitled to take four legitimate
wives. Although Moslem law demands that a man
who has several wives ought to treat them equally,
and forbids the neglect of one by preferring the
other, matters are generally different in reality. The
first wife, instead of retaining a certain pre-eminence,
as would be just, gradually becomes the servant of
her fellow-wife or wives; if not, her husband dismisses
her at last. It is impossible to give all the
particulars of the misery which needs must result
from such marriages, not only for the wife herself,
but very often also for her children.</p>

<p>The idea, that woman is a subordinate creature,
destined only to serve man, has been so to say
numerically expressed in the Mohammedan law of
inheritance, all the particulars of which are founded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>on the principle: two parts to man, one part to
woman. For instance, after the death of the wife,
the husband inherits a quarter of her fortune, in
case there are children; if there are none, half of it,
whereas, the wife inherits only a quarter or an
eighth. If several wives survive their husband,
they inherit these parts together. Accordingly,
daughters inherit only half as much as sons.</p>

<p>Very seldom a Mohammedan widow is married
again. She generally stays in her late husband's
house, in order to educate her children, for whom a
tutor is chosen. The tutor administers the children's
fortune and gives the mother as much money as is
necessary for their subsistence. When the children
are grown up, the mother generally stays for the rest
of her life at one of her sons', not so often at a
daughter's. In poor families, however, the woman
strives hard to gain her living by washing, spinning,
sewing, knitting stockings, and other things of that
kind. Later on the grown-up children sustain their
mother, so that women who have children spend
their old age in comparative comfort. If, however,
a widow, perhaps for want, consents to be married
again, her own condition may be improved, but her
children suffer.</p>

<p>Some older women must be mentioned who are
rather frequent in Moslem lands, and who form a
class by themselves. Generally they have been married
several times, but either have no children, or
have abandoned them to their fate. They pass their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>old age without a companion and gain their living
in as easy a manner as possible, being not very particular
in choosing the means. Outwardly they seem
to be utterly devoted to their religious duties, and
are always seen to murmur prayers and count their
beads, by which behavior even religious people are
often deceived so as to support them. On closer
observation, however, their real occupation proves
to be roaming about in the houses and intruding
themselves in a skilful and unobserved way in order
to spy out people's whereabouts. They try to make
themselves agreeable to the female members of the
household by tale-bearing or making commissions of
different kinds, particularly those which the women
cannot make themselves or which the landlord of the
house must not know about. Thus they gain influence
over those whom they have served, and assure
themselves of their gratitude. They promote love-intrigues,
make marriages, and so on; if desired,
they will also go to some celebrated fortune-teller,
in order to secure a talisman.</p>

<p>These talismans or amulets generally consist of a
scrap of paper, on which there are written sayings,
names, letters, figures, or signs with common ink,
or often with a yellow liquid made of saffron, musk,
or amber; sometimes even serpent's blood is used
for this purpose. If the talisman is to be worn on
the body, the paper is folded in the form of a triangle
or a quadrant, then wrapped in a piece of
cotton which has been made water-proof, and at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>last covered with a piece of fine cloth. The amulet
is fastened upon the head or tied around the upper-arm
or worn on the breast, with a string around
the neck. Some people sew it upon the inside of
their clothes so that it lies on the backbone or on
the heart. Sometimes the amulet must be fastened
with seven-colored silk. Sometimes also it is thrown
into water, to be drunk as soon as the writing is
dissolved, or it is burnt and they breathe the
smoke.</p>

<p>Talismans and amulets are said to protect men
and animals from the evil eye, from the bite of
wild beasts, and from wounds in war; they cause
love or hatred, they produce or prevent sleep and
madness. Their preparation is considered a special
science, which demands special study and is practised
by so-called magicians or fortune-tellers, but also by
dervishes, and even by priests. The latter generally
only write verses from the Koran, which women
wear around their neck as amulets.</p>

<p>Perhaps all this superstition is harmless in itself
or does a direct harm only to their purses. Indirectly,
however, it has a demoralizing influence
upon all classes of people, especially upon women,
who, as guardians of customs, are most attached to
these fables. Only true civilization and Christianity
will redeem and deliver.</p>

<p>In order to deepen the impression of what has
been said and to add something from real life, I will
tell the story of a Moslem woman, just as I heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>it in Kashgar, where I have been working for five
years for the spreading of the Gospel.</p>

<p>Some fifty years ago there lived in Kashgar a man
called Chodsha Burhaneddin. He was descended
from a family which since the middle of the seventeenth
century has given Kashgar its kings. His
fellow citizens esteemed him very much on account
of his strict observance of the religious prescriptions
of Islam. He married a woman of noble descent,
and for some time contented himself with his one
wife. But according to Islam it is a merit to take
if possible four wives, in order to increase the number
of the adherents of Islam. For this reason
Chodsha brought home another wife whenever he
travelled on business to the Russian town of Andishan
on that side of the Tienshan, until the number
of four was full. The consequence was that he not
only neglected his first wife, but even had her do all
the housework alone, thus making her the servant
of his three other wives. She had to serve them
from early morning till late at night. Without
grumbling and with great diligence the poor woman
took all the work upon herself; secretly, however,
she bewailed her hard lot and employed her few
free hours for the education of her little daughter.
However, she did not succeed in satisfying her husband.
He always found fault, beat her, and bade
her not show her face before him. His wife submitted
patiently and silently; she desisted even from
paying visits to her parents and acquaintances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>which would have given her some comfort, lest her
husband think she had gone to her beloved ones to
complain of his treatment. Four years passed.
Meanwhile several political revolutions had taken
place in Kashgar. In China the numerous Chinese
Mohammedans had revolted, and the revolt had
spread over the western countries. In eastern
Turkestan the Chinese officials as well as the soldiers
and the merchants had been killed by the Mohammedans;
only a few escaped death by accepting
Islam. This state of matters was put an end to by
Jakob Beg. He had come from Chanab Chokand,
north of the Tienshan, under the pretext of helping
the descendant of the old Kashgarian dynasty of
the Chodshas to the throne. In due time he put the
Prince aside and founded a kingdom of his own,
which included the whole of eastern Turkestan.
After taking hold of the government he tried to
weaken the Chodshas in every way possible, some of
them were assassinated, others put in prison in order
to be executed. One of the latter was Chodsha
Burhaneddin. As soon as his wife heard that her
husband had been made a prisoner, she hurried to
her father, who was well esteemed at Jakob Beg's
court, and besought him to make the most of his
influence in order to save her husband. Then she
prepared a meal, took it to her imprisoned husband,
and encouraged him. At his request she roused her
father still more so as to betake himself at once
to Jakob Beg, and to prevail on him to set the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>prisoner at liberty that same night. Chodsha Burhaneddin
returned to his house and entered the
room of his wife whom he had so long neglected, in
order to thank her for his delivery. Afterwards
she had one more child, a boy.</p>

<p>Some years after these events Chodsha fell ill.
Knowing that his end was near, repentance overwhelmed
him, and he asked his first wife to pardon
him whatever wrong he had done her. It was only
she whom he wished to be near him in his pains.
His other wives he did not at all care for now, and
detested them even in such a manner as to drive
them away, whenever they approached him. When
at last death had released him from his pains, his
three younger wives were married again, leaving
their children to their fate. His first wife, however,
remained faithful to him even after death; she refused
all proposals, honorable as some of them were,
and devoted herself entirely to the education of her
son and daughter, whom she lived to see married.</p>

<p>From this example, to which many others might
be added, it becomes clear to what deep humiliations
Mohammedan women are subject, and what
treasure of faithfulness and sacrifice are nevertheless
hidden in some of these oppressed and crushed
lives. Without knowing the doctrines of Christian
religion, Chodsha's wife had practised them. What
she dimly anticipated, has been fulfilled in her son,
whom I baptized as the first-fruits in Kashgar, and
received into the church. Did the Mohammedan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>women but know to what height Christianity would
raise them! Could they but compare the Mohammedan
proverb: "Do not ask a woman's advice, and
if she gives it, do the contrary," with the Apostle
Paul's words: "So ought men to love their wives as
their own bodies. He that loveth his wife, loveth
himself" (Ephes. <span class="smcap">v</span>:28), and "There is neither male
nor female, for ye are all one in Christ Jesus," they
would know the distance which separates Christian
views from those of Islam.</p>

<p>If on summer evenings when the heat of the day
is over, the inhabitant of a Mohammedan town goes
out for a walk to enjoy the evening coolness before
the gates, he will sometimes pass the burial-grounds.
Weeping and wailing come to his ear. Pitifully he
will look at the figures of mourning women who
are kneeling by the graves. But the sorrow which
is revealed there is not always meant for the loss
of some beloved one dead; very often women visit
the graves of their relations or, if they have none, of
saints, in order to weep out undisturbed and unheard
their hopeless, desolate lives. In their houses they
dare not give way to their sorrows for fear of their
husbands, therefore they go to the dead in order to
tell them their griefs!</p>

<p>May these words bring that sound of wailing to
the hearts of Christian women! May they, for
whom Christian morality has made life fair and
worthy, who as a beloved husband's true friend and
companion take part in his joys and sorrows, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>those who in the fulfilment of self-chosen duties
have found happiness and content, may they often
remember the hard fate of their Moslem sisters in
the Orient, and help carry the message of salvation
to them.</p>

<h2>IN FAR-OFF CATHAY</h2>


<p>The social condition of Mohammedan women in
Kansu Province in Northwest China is not so hard
as those of their sisters in the more western countries.
The Mohammedans, having been in China
now about a thousand years, have, save in the matter
of idolatry, practically adopted the Chinese customs,
even to the binding of the feet of their little
girls. Among the wealthier Mohammedans, as with
the wealthier Chinese, polygamy is common, many
having two or three wives, and among the middle
class, when there has been no issue by the first
wife, many take unto themselves a second wife.
Divorces are of rare occurrence.</p>

<p>There are no harems. The better-class women
are not seen much on the streets, but in the country
places, the farmer's wife, daughters, and daughters-in-law
go out into the fields, weed and reap the
corn, carry water, gather in fuel, and wear no veil.
The daughters and daughters-in-law of the better
class, from the age of fifteen to thirty, often wear a
black veil when going on a visit to their friends, as
also do the Chinese.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>
<p>In the busy farming seasons, the Mohammedan
men, with their wives of the poorer class, hire themselves
out to the Chinese farmers, and come down in
large numbers to weed in the spring and gather in
the corn in summer and autumn. They bring their
children with them and stay on the farm till the
busy time is over. We always get a goodly number
of visits from them.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Mohammedan male population
in our prefecture of Si-ning, the vast majority are
ignorant of the tenets of the Koran, know little of
anything, save that Masheng-ren is their prophet,
and that there is a Supreme Being somewhere of
whom they are almost as ignorant as the Chinese.
They seem to realize it a duty to attend worship
on two special occasions each year, but the majority
of them never darken the mosque doors at other
times. Seldom a day passes but we have Mohammedan
visitors, and the answer we get from nine out
of every ten to questions about their doctrine is, "We
are only blind folks and we do not know anything."
Their ah-hongs or pastors do not trouble
to teach any save the students, for which they are
paid. Some even speak of heaven as being Khuda
(God). In many ways are they influenced by the
Chinese around them.</p>

<p>Already I have referred to the binding of the
feet of their little girls. In sickness it is a common
thing to see the patient with a tiny book written in
Arabic bound up in red cloth and sewn on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>shoulder or back of the outside garment, to shield
them from the evil spirits. Many also observe the
lucky and unlucky days in the Chinese calendar, by
removing from one house to another. One of our
patients had even resorted to the Buddhists or agnostics
to recite prayers and use charms to drive
away his sickness.</p>

<p>At the present rate of spiritual declension, in another
century many will either be Buddhists or
agnostics.</p>

<p>The times of prayer are not observed save by the
ah-hongs and mullahs and a few of the old men.</p>

<p>These few particulars showing the indifference
and ignorance among the men, what can be expected
of the women? They are heathen, except in
name. In our prefecture, we receive a welcome
among them whenever we go, but how long this
will continue it is hard to tell. In the southwest of
this province, where formerly much friendliness was
shown towards the missionaries, latterly a spirit of
bitterness and opposition has been manifested owing
to a few becoming interested in the Gospel and
attending regularly on Sunday. The ah-hongs have
warned their people that if any join the church they
will be put to death when the foreign ambassador
arrives from Turkey. Who this individual is, is
not very apparent, and from whence he will get his
power to put Chinese subjects to death is a mystery.
Doubtless it is only a scheme of the ah-hongs to put
the people in fear.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>
<p>So far, however, we have open doors here and no
opposition, but owing to lack of workers there is <span class="smcap">no
one to enter in, no one</span> to take the Bread of
Life to them, <span class="smcap">no one</span> to bear the glad news to
them.</p>

<p>After the rebellion of 1895, when retribution fell
heavily on the Mohammedans, thousands of them
were reduced to the verge of starvation; women,
who had been accustomed to the comforts of a good
home, were deprived of their warm winter clothing
and left only with thin summer tattered garments,
right in the depth of winter with a thermometer
registering below zero (Fahrenheit). By the help
of many kind friends in different parts of China, we
were enabled to open a soup-kitchen and provide hot
food every day for six weeks, during the bitterest
part of the winter, to an average of three hundred
persons each day, and also to give away several
warm garments to those in direst need. Every day
we taught the people to repeat hymns, grace before
meat, and told them stories from the Bible. On the
Chinese New Year's Day we gave them a special
treat of mutton-broth and afterwards showed them,
with the magic lantern, some scenes in the life of our
Lord. In the winter of 1896-7 we again provided
food to an average of one hundred and twenty each
day, nearly all widows and children.</p>

<p>When the rebellion was over the Mohammedans
were no longer permitted to reside in the east suburb,
where formerly they numbered ten thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>persons, save a few of the poor widows who gained
a subsistence by begging, but were sent to reside in
a few villages thirty miles from the city. Occasionally
we have a visit from some of the women
and it is cheering to find that they remember much
of what was told them in those years of their adversity,
and we may hope that some at least will
meet us in the white-robed throng hereafter.</p>

<p>At present we have one Mohammedan woman,
much interested in the Gospel, who comes regularly
to worship on Sundays when the farmers are not
busy. One difficulty stands in their way and that
is, the Chinese women hate them and scorn to sit
beside them, and we cannot wonder, for they have
suffered much at their hands, many having lost
their all twice in their lifetime, and some thrice;
nevertheless, we are thankful for the more Christ-like
spirit shown towards them by the Christians,
who are willing to forget the past and give them
a welcome, converse with them freely, and recognize
them as sisters for whom also Christ hath died.</p>

<p>There are two sects of Mohammedans in our district
and there are often serious quarrels between
them, and some of the people fear that if many
Mohammedans became Christians serious trouble
might ensue; but we feel sure that if the Christians
manifest the spirit of their Master, loving their enemies,
blessing their persecutors, praying for those
who ill-treat them, that finally they would disarm
their hatred and be permitted to live in peace;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>whereas the two sects lacking that inward spiritual
grace, hating each other, and backbiting each other,
finally bring about strife.</p>

<p>The careful readers of this chapter will observe
from what we have written that the life of their
Mohammedan sisters in China is not so hard and
prison-like as that of their sisters in North Africa,
Persia, etc, where they are secluded for a lifetime
in the prison-like harems at the command of their
husbands. Nevertheless, their need is just as great,
their souls just as precious, their ignorance of spiritual
things just as deep, their lives just as much of
a blank, their hope for the future just as dark; they
live and die "just like animals," they are wont to
say; and all the hopelessness, darkness, and lovelessness
continues not because of their <span class="smcap">seclusion</span>
in harems at the mercy of their husbands but because
of their <span class="smcap">exclusion</span> from their right to the
joys and hope of the Christian life by the lukewarm
indifference of the Church of Christ to-day,
which fails to realize the great responsibility to
carry the Gospel to every creature.</p>

<p>In our vast parish, stretching one hundred miles
from east to west and two hundred and thirty miles
from southeast to northwest, comprising six cities,
sixteen walled towns, and thousands of villages with
a mixed population of Chinese, Mohammedans,
Mongolians, Tibetans, and aborigines, my husband
and I are left to labor alone. This does not spell
seclusion but exclusion from the knowledge of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>Way of Salvation for tens of thousands of souls
for whom Christ died.</p>

<p>When Jesus saw the leper He had compassion on
him; when He saw the widow of Nain He said
"Weep not"; when the mourners wept at the grave
of Lazarus He saw them and wept also; when He
looked from the Mount of Olives on the city of
Jerusalem and thought of her doom, He wept.
Would that in a vision or in a dream of the night,
you could behold something of the hopelessness of
your less favored sisters; would that you could hear
just a few of their plaintive cries and see tears rolling
down their cheeks as they unburden their sorrows
to the sympathetic ear. Then, methinks, you
would not rest till you had accomplished something
to make these many dark hearts brighter and sad
hearts lighter.</p>

<h2>OUR MOSLEM SISTERS IN JAVA</h2>

<h3>(<i>Translated from the Dutch</i>)</h3>


<p>The life of the Mohammedan woman in general
here is not that of a being on a par with man, but
rather comparable with that of a dumb animal, a
creature inferior to and much less worthy than man,
which is kept and utilized as long as it performs
some services.</p>

<p>Fatalism, as taught and nourished by Islam,
places the woman in a servile relationship to the
man, so much so that she, although considered a
creature of no particular value, does not take offence
at being accounted a negligible quantity.</p>

<p>Maltreatment of women takes place occasionally
but is by no means general, because nothing hinders
the husband from driving away his wife with whom
he may not be satisfied, without even observing the
simplest form of a legal procedure.</p>

<p>Why should the man, particularly amongst Moslems,
"the Lord of Creation," weary himself or
even become angry, seeing it is far wiser and more
profitable that he exchange the worn-out wife and
mother, who can no longer add to the number of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>children, for a younger and stronger wife? This
profitable barter, too, need cost him but a trifle.</p>

<p>This exchange of wives has even a more demoralizing
tendency than the practice of polygamy
itself, which luxury only those can participate in
whose salary is at least fifteen florins per month.</p>

<p>The results of the sinful practice of polygamy,
especially for the children and consequently for the
state, would be less sad to contemplate, were it not
that the polygamist exchanges his wife as readily
for another as he who can afford but one wife
at a time.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary for me to enumerate here
the effects of this evil of which the wife is the victim.</p>

<p>This much-loved evil is a strong bulwark against
the spread of the ethics of Christianity.</p>

<p>A second and a very powerful opponent of mission
work is found in the peculiar Mohammedan
village organization, in which the Moslem sheikh or
spiritual leader plays the most important rôle.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity of Islam here, is the fact
that the inland population and the millions of inhabitants
who live in the lowlands of Java are
peculiarly interrelated and mutually dependent.
Only in a few of the larger towns in Java do we
find the trades practised.</p>

<p>The villager is a farmer, and since rice is the chief
article of food and this must be raised by irrigation
channels in a hilly country like Java, the vil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>lagers
are, as a matter of course, compelled to live at
peace with one another, becoming interdependent
through the production of the staff of life.</p>

<p>A Moslem family that becomes Christian soon
experiences deprivation. The so-called "silent
power" soon makes its influence felt, ostracising
them from every privilege.</p>

<p>This becomes the more easy to understand when
we remember that the division of the cultivable soil
and of the water supply with all other civil rights
and privileges, are entrusted by Dutch law to the
Mohammedan village government, in which the
Moslem sheikh or priest enjoys an ex-officio vote.</p>

<p>Because of this peculiar condition of life in the
East Indies, the writer and other missionaries in
Java have purposely settled in an inland district in
the very midst of the Mohammedan population,
where those families who have embraced Christianity
may gather about the mission centre and gradually
form a nucleus (in course of time a village or
town), where independent legal privileges may be
enjoyed and the people ruled over by their own
native Christian chiefs. In this manner these communities
can gradually become "a salt" and "a
light" for their Mohammedan environment.</p>

<p>Of very much importance in this connection is
the action taken by Her Majesty, our beloved Queen
Wilhelmina, who&mdash;at the request of our former
Minister of Colonies, the Honorable Mr. Van Idenburg,
at present Governor of Paramaribo, in South
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>America&mdash;commissioned the States-General of the
Netherlands to describe and protect the legal status
of the native Christians.</p>

<p>By reason of this our Christian converts can now
claim at least the right of existence, and even the
native Christian woman can obtain that justice before
the law to which she is entitled.</p>

<h2>THE MOHAMMEDAN WOMEN OF MALAYSIA</h2>


<p>Malaysia comprises the Malay Peninsula and
Archipelago. The latter includes the great islands
of Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Celebes, and innumerable
smaller ones. The one island of Java contains
about three-fourths of the entire population of
Malaysia, which is probably about forty millions. The
vast majority of the population are Mohammedans,
but the hill-tribes of the Peninsula and of the larger
islands are still heathen, the Dyaks of Borneo and
the Battas of Sumatra being the most numerous of
the non-Mohammedan races. There are also many
hundreds of thousands of Chinese immigrants in
Malaysia, of whom only one here and there have become
Mohammedan.</p>

<p>The principal Mohammedan races are: (1) the
Malays proper, who inhabit the Peninsula, the east
coast of Sumatra, and the neighboring islands, and
are scattered to some extent amongst all the seaport
towns of the Archipelago; (2) in Sumatra, the
Achinese in the north, and the Rejans and Lampongs
in the south; (3) in Java, the Sundanese in the
west, the Javanese in the centre and east, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>Madurese in the extreme east; and (4) the Bugis in
Celebes.</p>

<p>The greatest success in the conversion of Mohammedans
to Christianity has been achieved by the
German (Barmen) Mission in Sumatra, and chiefly
among the Battas, a very numerous heathen race,
who have been gradually won in small numbers to
the faith of Islam, probably for centuries. About
fifty thousand of the Battas are now Christians,
and many of these were at one time Mohammedans.</p>

<p>In Java the Dutch have made considerable efforts
to convert the natives to Christianity for three hundred
years past, and as the result of this early work
there are considerable Christian communities still
existing. It is only within the last century, however,
that the work of the missionary societies has
infused new life into the work of converting the
Mohammedans. The greatest numerical success has
been achieved by those who devote their efforts to
the founding of Christian communities in villages of
their own, entirely distinct from the Mohammedans,
with their own Christian village headmen. It is
found that in the Mohammedan villages the Christians
suffer so much persecution from the headmen
and others, that in some cases Christianity has been
entirely stamped out, and the Christians have disappeared,
no one knows where. The Christian villages
have in most cases been established in unsettled
districts, whole families being moved from other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>places, and clearing the jungle to form their own
settlements. These people have been won to Christ
by preaching among the Mohammedans, and are protected
from persecution by thus gathering them into
Christian communities. Much work is also done by
means of schools and dispensaries. The Dutch Government
provides both the school buildings and
salaries of schoolmasters, under certain rules, and it
also erects hospitals, and provides medicines free to
every missionary. There are also instances in which
Christian communities have grown up in the midst
of Mohammedan surroundings, and it is claimed that
such Christians are of a stronger type, and exercise
a more powerful influence among their fellow-countrymen.
A Dutch missionary writes that
polygamy and divorce are very prevalent in Java,
there being many who have changed husbands or
wives as many as ten or twenty times. The man
has to pay the priest two guilders for a divorce, but
a woman would have to pay twenty-five guilders;
the latter is known as "Buffalo divorce," i. e., brutal.
In Java the second wife is called "A fire in the
house." Four wives are allowed, and any number
of concubines. In case of divorce the girls follow
the father, and the boys follow the mother. Divorced
women are often in straitened circumstances
and become concubines or the kept mistresses of
Europeans or even of the Chinese.</p>

<p>The largest Christian communities in Malaysia
are in North Celebes and on the island of Amboina.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>These are the result of the early labors of the
chaplains of the Dutch East India Company.</p>

<p>Among the Malays proper very little missionary
work has been attempted and practically nothing
has been accomplished. From 1815 to 1843 the
London Missionary Society carried on work among
the Malays at Penang, Malacca, and Singapore, but
then withdrew all their missionaries to China, with
the exception of Rev. B. P. Keasberry, who continued
to work among the Malays in Singapore as a
self-supporting missionary until his death, in 1872.
He baptized a few Malays, both men and women,
one or two of whom are still living, but make no
profession of Christianity. Within the last twenty
years we know of one Malay man and two or three
women who have been converted to Christianity and
baptized in Singapore and Penang, none of whom
has gone back to Islam.</p>

<p>The extent to which polygamy is practised among
the Malays depends very greatly upon the amount
which has to be paid as dowry, and this varies very
much in the different parts of the Peninsula and
Eastern Sumatra. Divorce, however, is common
everywhere. In our personal intercourse with the
Malays, we have realized how very much the women
resemble those of other nationalities in their aspirations,
but how useless it is for them to try to make
any real progress, because they are so tied by customs.
They say, "We must be content to live as we
do, for we are powerless to do otherwise." When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>they go out for walks they must be closely veiled or
covered, and must walk in front of the men, which
seems courteous to us until we are told the reason,
which is that the men can watch them, and see that
they do not cast glances at other men. Many of the
women learn to read the Koran, and a few learn to
read and write Malayan in the government vernacular
schools, but the latter is sometimes objected to on
the ground that the girls will write letters to men.
It is very difficult to get Malay girls to attend a
Christian school, for fear they might become Christians.
The people living in the agricultural districts
seem to be happy and contented, and yet here polygamy
is more common than in the towns. The heart
of the wife and mother is often burdened because
her husband has taken a second or third wife, when
there is little enough money for one family to live
upon. As a rule the men do not want their wives
to know when they are taking new wives. They
usually say they are going away to work for a few
days. We have been asked to write letters to such
husbands requesting money, and begging the husband
to return. Sometimes the answers to these
letters contain loving messages to the wife, asking
her not to believe the stories told her, but still he
returns not, or worse still, no money comes. The
wives with tears streaming down their cheeks say,
"How can his small wages support three or four
wives?" In one case a wife received a letter saying
that she could marry again, as the husband had de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>cided
to marry another woman. We have been
asked by such deserted wives to enclose love potions
or medicine in letters to win back the love of the
husbands. The love potions consist of the ashes of a
piece of paper which has had some words written on
it and is afterwards burnt, the ashes being put in a
paper, enclosed in a letter and sent to a friend, who
is requested to put it in a cup of coffee, and give
it to the wayward husband. One woman whom we
knew personally had been deserted by her husband;
she lived in a house by herself, and would not leave
it for more than an hour at a time, fearing her husband
would return and accuse her of unfaithfulness.
She earned her living partly by taking in sewing,
and her relatives would help her as they could. A
young girl was to be married to a man who had a
wife and family in another town. We asked the
girl's mother if she knew about this. She replied,
"Yes, but he has fair wages; he can support two
wives." We enquired of a relative of the bridegroom's
first wife if she knew her husband was to
be married again. She answered, "He will not tell
her, but I am sure she will feel it in her heart."
In many cases the deserted wives have to support
the children, which they do by sewing or making and
selling cakes.</p>

<h2>"WHAT WILT THOU HAVE ME TO DO?"</h2>


<p>Those of us who have read the pages of this book
right through to the end, will find such words as are
at the head of this chapter rise involuntarily to our
lips. What must we do?</p>

<p>Thank God, He has a plan. "He sent not His Son
into the world to condemn the world, but that the
world through Him might be saved." "It is not
the will of your Father in Heaven that one of these
little ones should perish." Then let us all ask Him
to teach us how these countless Moslem women and
girls may be saved. He can bless the old ways of
work and He can lead into new ways.</p>

<p>The following methods have been tried and each
one is capable of further development.</p>

<p>Women's medical work has removed prejudice
and opened closed doors. We should have many
more women missionary doctors. We should also
have many qualified nurses, especially those skilled
in midwifery. They are often only summoned to
attend difficult or dangerous cases, so that it is a
necessity to be <i>thoroughly efficient</i>, and they need to
do the work in a missionary spirit. Women's hospitals
as a base of operations are needed, so that those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>who cannot be attended to in their own homes, with
any hope of cure, may be admitted to the hospital.
But there should be associated with every nurse or
doctor some workers who are wholly given up to
evangelistic work. Through lack of these much of
the influence of the medical missionary fails to
accomplish its wished-for result. The doctors and
nurses feel this themselves strongly. The same is
felt everywhere amongst educational missionaries.
The work of the school needs to be followed up by
the visit to the home. There are countless doors
open to the young wives who have been taught in
school, and who would delight in a visit from one of
the mission ladies.</p>

<p>This might be done by older workers and we earnestly
urge that women's missionary boards and
societies should be willing to receive women for this
department older than they can take for school or
medical work. The language is learnt through constant
intercourse with the women. If older women
who could meet their own expenses might be allowed
to give themselves solely to this evangelistic work,
we believe that a large increase would be made to
our missionary force.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Cry of Distress from Algiers</span></span>
</div>

<p><br />Women's settlements are only beginning to be
tried in different parts of the field, but we believe
that this method would be found very helpful both
in towns and villages, but especially in the villages.
The thought is, to have a group of about four
workers and one or two native helpers living to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>gether,
composing a women's household, into which
the Moslem women may freely come without fear
of meeting any men. These settlements should be
within easy reach of an ordinary mission station, so
that the work should be part of the whole, and the
husbands should be cared for by others at the same
time. School, medical, and evangelistic work may
all be done from a settlement.</p>

<p>It is felt in the educational work that girl's boarding
schools are far more fruitful for good than day
schools. One sort of school that seems to have had
the happiest results has been where a lady missionary
has a little group of some twelve girls living with
her. They are her companions night and day; she
shares all their conversation, their play, their household
duties, their lessons. The pure, refining influence
of her constant companionship has more effect
on these young lives than any other that has been
tried. Will not many Christian women give themselves
to such work as this?</p>

<p>Much might be done in the way of small orphanages
for girls, or homes where the children of divorced
mothers might be received.</p>

<p>The possibilities before us of what these girls
might become through the home training of several
years are almost unlimited. The natural intelligence
and sweetness of character shown by many of them
show what might be made of them. They have all
the light-heartedness and merry ways of western
girls, with the same tenderness towards suffering.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>And at the same time there is a strength of character
and determination of will that not only explains, perhaps,
many of the divorces which now take place, but
it raises hopes of what these girls may become, and
may accomplish for the regeneration of their people.</p>

<p>If they become followers of Christ, they are of
the stuff of which martyrs are made. One little
girl in a mission school in Egypt stood up in front
of all her companions and boldly said that she believed
in Jesus. The news was quickly told at home
and she was severely beaten. A day or two afterwards,
she was back in her place at school. Her
teacher asked had she been beaten very much.
"Yes," she said, "but never mind, wasn't Jesus
beaten for me?"</p>

<p>The centuries of oppression that have passed over
the heads of these women have not crushed their
spirit. It rises afresh against all the stupidity and
ignorance of those who oppress them. And men
still find out even among Moslems:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What man on earth hath power or skill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stem the torrent of a woman's will?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For when she will, she will, you may depend on't,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when she won't, she won't, and there's an end on't."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That efforts to educate and train the girls are
really appreciated by the men is evident from one
fact known of large training schools in Syria. We
are told that not one girl graduated there has been
divorced, nor have any of their husbands introduced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>a second wife into their homes. This shows us that
what the Moslem man really needs is a wife who is
able to be a companion to him. One who can talk to
him, keep his home neat, and knows how to take care
of his children. And in many a case the lessons of
heavenly things which the young wife has learnt
at school have been willingly listened to by the
husband.</p>

<p>The chief aim in our work should be to have constant
touch with the girls, to love them, to win their
love, and to live Christ before them, not resting satisfied
with anything short of their salvation.</p>

<p>But all this needs to be taken up in dead earnest;
and Christian women can only do it in the power of
the Holy Spirit, yielding their lives wholly to the
Lord for it. If we do rise to it, and diligently give
ourselves to win the women and girls of Islam for
Christ, and train them up to live for Him in their
homes, we shall find the answer to Abraham's prayer
for his son Ishmael begin to come true: "As for
Ishmael I have heard thee. Behold I have blessed
him,"&mdash;and God's blessing <i>is life for evermore</i>.</p>

<p>And to Our Moslem Sisters may come again the
words that were spoken to Hagar: "<i>The Lord hath
heard thy affliction.</i>" "<i>And she called the name of the
Lord that spake unto her, Thou God seest me, for she
said, Have I also here looked after Him that seeth
me.</i>" The fountain of water in the wilderness by
which the angel found her was called Beer lahai-roi:
"<i>The well of Him that liveth and seeth me.</i>" And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>the very name of Ishmael means, "<i>God shall hear.</i>"
Is it not an invitation and an encouragement to us
to take on our hearts these multitudes of their children
and claim the promises for them? <i>Blessing is
life.</i> "<i>I am come that they might have life and that
they might have it more abundantly.</i>"</p>

<p>For this end we ask you to enter into a covenant
of prayer with us, that we may not cease to intercede
for our broken-hearted sisters, that they may be
comforted, and for the captives of Satan, that they
may be set free, that the prison gates may be opened
for them so that the oil of joy may be given them
for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit
of heaviness.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Life! life! eternal life!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jesus alone is the giver.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life! life! abundant life!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glory to Jesus for ever."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When this Life becomes theirs, Our Moslem Sisters
will be our own sisters in a new sense of the
word, and we shall see the evangelization of the
Mohammedan home and of all Moslem lands.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">
<span class="smcap">A Prayer.</span>
</p>

<p>"O Lord God, to whom the sceptre of right belongeth,
lift up Thyself and travel in the greatness
of Thy strength throughout the Mohammedan lands
of the East; because of the anointing of Thy Son
Jesus Christ as Thy true Prophet, Priest, and King,
destroy the sword of Islam, and break the yoke of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>the false prophet Mohammed from off the necks of
Egypt, Arabia, Turkey, Persia, and other Moslem
lands, so that there may be opened throughout these
lands a great door and effectual for the Gospel, that
the Word of the Lord may have free course and be
glorified, and the veil upon so many hearts may be
removed, through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen."
(From the C. M. S. Cycle of Prayer.)<br /><br /></p></div>
